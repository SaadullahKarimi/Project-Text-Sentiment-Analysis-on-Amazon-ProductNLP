72,5,it,Verified,Italy,11/1/2020,43,"What to say? My daughter LOVES him and I with her. Very soft, zero visible seams, tender and especially functional. It reproduces according to the choice of music, white noise, the sound of the Breath or heartbeat. Also the otter tummy lights up and moves as if breathing. For the newborn is a real comfort in the cradle, always kept in safety, I place it away from his face so that he can perceive it even just by touching it with his hand. Wonderful purchase, we are really happy!"
85,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,9/10/2019,36,"I decided to test this plush to my grandson, just three years old. As soon as he saw it he was very happy and he exclaimed it was: ""Zia, it's very soft!"" Actually the plush is really soft to the touch and a real companion for the nights, of our children. The animal represented is a gray otter, a toy animal that is able to help children play and also relax, during the night and during the time they rest. This otter is able to emit vibrations that calm and relax the child, but also of music, very sweet. It is suitable for babies from 0 months up, let's say until 3-4 years of age. In any case, even if the kids get bigger, will remain his companion at night and play. An aspect that struck me, it was the fact of having used the sounds of nature, to relax and calm the little ones and I have to say that they really work. The sounds have a length of about half-hour. Our bright effects are also attractive in the AAA."
107,5,it,Verified,Italy,8/12/2019,2,"An unusual pet, this otter is beautiful! Cute melodies, light in the tummy and fantastic ""breath"" mode.. I bought it to put it near my 2 month old baby when sleeps because he likes contact very much, it didn't work but we love it when wake up!!:) only flaws the price a little 'high even if much lower than the store"
109,4,it,Verified,Italy,4/2/2021,1,"Beautiful, soft and very relaxing. It comes with behind (back) the keys you can select (-/+ for the volume, the notes for the type of music to select, the type of noise you want to put (heart beat, white noise etc, the belly moving or not, the light on or off).. all these keys are great and customizable depending on what the baby wants. My (10 months) is used to sleeping with the music box all night long and otter has a duration of 30 Min, but alas I wouldn't know if she might like it since she doesn't sleep absolutely with puppets.. but I can say that to this she has become fond of in a hurry (which is very strange).. we will see in the next nights if I can introduce her into the dwarfs!! Anyway recommended purchase, the only flaw is that 5.99 euro shipping is too much!!! At the end it costs less in the store!!"
113,4,it,Verified,Italy,21/02/2020,2,"Plush tender, my 16-month-old loves it, sleeps hugged and cuddles him even when he wakes up. I put four stars because unfortunately, at least in my case, the mechanism that makes the belly of the puppet raise and lower emits an annoying hum. However, it remains effective in the function of the white noises and of the breath, that reconcile the sleep to my baby accompanying her towards a deep sleep and now is for her an indispensable companion! It does not do miracles, if sleeplessness or agitation are due to other ailments (e.g. identification) you have to intervene to solve those, but even in these cases the plush helps the child at least to relax and comfort, along with the cuddles of mom and dad, obviously!"
115,5,it,Verified,Italy,12/11/2019,3,"I love it, simply. I bought it after seeing it in a shop, I fell in love with it right away. Very soft and relaxing. The sounds are lovely and the heart movement is simply divine!!"
116,5,it,Verified,Italy,25/10/2019,5,"Beautiful product, the only problem and that the puppet has little padding so you feel a lot the plastic of the internal machine. Despite that, my 2.5 year old adores it, and sleeps hugged every night."
125,5,it,Verified,Italy,7/8/2020,2,"Perfect!! Relaxed very much my son of 4 months, it was a salvation especially to promote sleep and relieve a little the small problems of the teeth and colics. Before he slept only in his arms or anyway he had to feel my contact now I can relax because he relaxes also with this nice otter"
138,5,it,Verified,Italy,25/04/2020,,"The otter accompanies the dwarfs of my baby with its sweet melodies, much prettier than those of the music box that I had bought her. It is very soft and, if you put the breath mode, raises and lowers the belly.( the batteries with this mode are consumed at the speed of light though) Otherwise you can only put the music mode and set the volume. (the keys are behind the plush). It is easy to wash, just remove the envelope from the rigid inside through a zip."
146,2,it,Verified,Italy,23/11/2020,,"Functional carillon, my 4 month old girl falls asleep listening to the melodies that play sweetly for 30 minutes. I find it useless everything else (breath and various sounds) and I don't know if maybe the light can serve later. The design is bad, this animal nn is not at all nice to see for the little ones, so much so that I had to make some changes (put a pink dress, add a bow in the head and create the eyes). The controls are inside the puppet and therefore not practical: if the baby sleeps awake with the noise of the tear that gives access to the various buttons. For what it is, it is really too expensive."
155,5,it,Verified,Italy,21/01/2020,1,A little expensive but my baby likes it to death. It has several sounds and the light on the tummy helps to make her fall asleep.Along with the rhythmic movement of the abdomen and the sound of the heart beating makes my baby fall asleep in no time... recommended!
166,5,it,Verified,Italy,11/10/2020,,"This plush is gorgeous!! I bought it for my 6-month-old to help him sleep alone. Actually the otter was literally kidnapped by my 2-year-old son. He fell in love with the belly that goes up and down and doesn't want to be without it anymore. The otter is fantastic easy to wash. Even the music adjustments, tummy light up and down are easy to set up. I'm really happy with the purchase."
172,5,it,Verified,Italy,22/07/2020,,"The sounds (adjustable volume fortunately), the light on the tummy and the slow but continuous movement of the breath relax the child, so much so that he falls asleep even hugged!It is not very soft, at least not where there is the electronic part, but it is not dangerous."
194,5,it,Verified,Italy,14/12/2020,,"I loved this plush already from the photos and descriptions and when I received it confirmed my expectations! I took it for my baby of 5 months and when I never discovered it before!! The noises of the womb make him fall asleep practically immediately! The melodies are really relaxing, you can adjust the volume (and it is not a trivial thing) the tummy that moves is really nice to see! You can program the function (for example melody + light or breath + light...) that we want to make the baby listen and then just press the button on the belly and then goes on for 30 min then turns off. The only defect is that the buttons to change programming are behind and closed by a strap (safer method for the baby but equally noisy).. If there was a small zip of those missing would be better! For the rest the extra advice! Quality report - great price!"
195,5,it,Verified,Italy,16/11/2019,2,"Wonderful in all this otter! Soft, even considering that it has a great deal inside, beautiful music, soft noises, nice face and cuddle... Perfect!"

201,5,it,Verified,Italy,20/10/2020,1,"Fantastic, various music and white noises including a nice sound of snoring and heartbeat, has a light on the sandwich that lights up, and the sandwich simulates the movement of the breath, recommended"

Easy to wash in the washing machine, after removing the internal mechanism. Put also in the dryer.Two defects... the mechanism inside, easily removable, is very heavy, and needs 4 batteries that are discharged quite quickly."
237,4,it,Verified,Italy,7/2/2021,,"Cute and useful for the bed, we use it x sleep it when the repertoire of lullaby runs out! Once asleep we leave it on in the cradle so as to limit the awakenings.. It turns off alone after a half hour.use little the functions breath and light, colors a little off, from awake nn attract a lot x play."
243,5,it,Verified,Italy,19/09/2020,,"I bought it for my grandson who is now two and a half months old. When I took it he was just 10 days old and maybe he was too young to appreciate it. Instead, starting from the second month we put him close to him with the music and he falls asleep or calms down or stays awake but entertains him. I think it's a great game even when he will be a little bigger. Now he only listens to all the sounds that the otter transmits, maybe more there will also appreciate the fact that the new belly and the light on."

The only small defect is the fact that it's a bit noisy the movement that reproduces the breath.It's a purchase that I recommend.
269,5,it,Verified,Italy,25/09/2020,,"Plush very cuddly, if you press the tummy you turn on the soft light and start automatically the relaxing music rotating together with the breath. Behind the back there is a pocket where you can set the volume, the music, the white noises and the mechanical breathing."

1316,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,13/11/2019,6,"It works! And it's the most important thing! It helps a lot both to relax, that to accompany the children towards the bed, but it works well also as anti-stress, for those moments when the puppets tend to be more ""soundy"" or they feel neglected. Excellent pet this otter! (even if many will exchange it for a bear...), it turns out to be much more useful than expected. If you don't find it disturbing! Actually the breath, with movement, colors and sounds, is very realistic. In fact you can set noises, relaxing sounds (also human like the heartbeat) and music. You can match us a soft light on the belly, and see it move following the breath. Everything is customizable and can be activated by the battery pack, which has a rather tenacious button, to prevent it from starting inadvertently. The integrated timer is about 30 minutes! Shuttering the battery pack, you can also wash in the washing machine! Also, I would have a little flaw for the rest, I would have been finely padded to the rest of the rest of the material!"
1320,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,12/10/2019,4,"This otter has a very good look and super tender; it is made of polyester and is really soft. It is beige with the inner part of the ears and the plants of the feet in blue fabric. Even the inside of the codina is made of fabric with a lovely drawing of small fishes. The eyes are closed and the arms are sewn to the chest, but they are absolutely not attached to the body, so you can fit a small hand. The dimensions are 25 x 15,5 x 11 cm. and weighs almost half a kilo, because inside, closed by a velcro, it hosts a battery, gigantic, which allows you to adjust the volume and choose which sound you want to listen to your baby through keys with very clear designs. In fact, you can choose between soft music or some relaxing sounds (white noises, sounds of the womb, breath during sleep or heartbeat)."
1322,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,16/10/2019,3,"I took this delicious otter for my grandson, to accompany him in his nap. It is a really intelligent game-help that I wanted to have available when my children were young, because it combines the usual combination of sounds and soft lights, also the movement of the tummy that swells and deflates, giving the impression of breathing together with the child. How many parents have noticed the calming effect of holding the children against their chest to calm them with the perception of their breath? Well, the otter does just that. The baby leans on this soft puppet, wanting to put a hand on us, perceives softness, warmth of the hair, movement of the breath and in addition the music chosen (from true melodies to more neutral sounds). Just regular first volume and sounds on the back, then the otter keeps company for thirty minutes. Very useful object and splendid gift idea."

It represents a beige otter, with ears and feet of a light green and the package reproduces a baby cot very cute. You turn on pressing the tummy, it works with batteries (4 batteries AA 1.5V already included in the package). In it we find the box battery holder, where you can choose one of the four functions of the game: music or relaxing sounds, you can distinguish the sounds of the maternal womb and also sounds of nature that help calm babies. You can feel the breath during sleep and combine the function that simulates a natural breath with the movement of the belly that goes up and down. You can also choose to associate a soft light (which would be the area of the button on the belly). In short, you can customize it as you want. And very nice thing that pushes me to give full of the votes, once removed the box of batteries, you can safely wash in a 30 °. Excellent solution!"

The otter was made with a device inserted inside the body of the plush, a mechanism that can be removed by removing it from the back of the otter thanks to a good opening with the velcro, in this way it is also possible to wash the plush in the washing machine. The device has six buttons: - The first two serve to increase or decrease the volume of the music and sounds reproduced by the otter; - The third reproduces the music of some lullaby in rotation, and turns off automatically after thirty minutes; - The fourth reproduces the breath while sleeping, the sound of the wind, the heartbeat and the heartbeat when it is active in the womb, to switch from one type of sound to the other, it is enough to press the button: the first time will stop the sound and the second time will be activated by the sound; the fifth one can lift the breath to the next."

I try in my reviews to be always impartial, but with products of this type ( turned to babies/children) I try to be even more picky precisely for the mission they have. We start immediately saying that the brand in this sense is a certainty, although many do not know that Fisher Price is totally part of the Mattel group since 1993 and that within a few hanni the company that controls it closed all the factories in the USA and transferred all the production in CINA. This small niche just to remind you that despite the very high standards and quality and maniac attention to details as well as the materials of the first order we are talking about the most beautiful products made in CHINA. Having said this, this small (to want to look at it well then much) pet is really addictive..I would say that all the soft plus is a soft feature of the very soft packing mechanism and picking it up with the power of the inside chamber, which I am able to clean up, but it creates an addiction!"

The product is made of polyester with a beige and blue color for the plant of the feet and the inner area of the ear; the tail is blue with some bright fishes. The consistency of the otter is very soft and delicate. When you will start the music relaxing and calming, the game will realistically imitate human breathing with movements in the belly to up and down with a pleasant lighting effect. The backs have a pre-defined duration of 30 minutes, it is possible to finish the reproduction, touching the button on the belly. The sounds that the otters appear to be pleasant and relaxing for the newborns that from the trials are also in the best of the days, during its many episodes of crying."

Very soft and cared for in every detail, we speak of a toy designed for babies, therefore I try dangerous parts. But the plus of this toy is that pressing the tummy lights up and the otter simulates the movement of the breathing, emitting sounds and music. It can be created the ideal combination for each child, selecting the type of sound/music, the furate and the volume. Inside there is the \cuore of the toy, or the feeding (it works with 4 batteries included) and the electronic unit that allows to make movements and sounds. These elements can be removed thus allowing to wash the baby's birthplace in the bedroom. A cure for the design is already reproduced in the small."
1350,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,8/11/2019,,"Finally, a puppet representing a different animal! Not the usual bears that, although cuddly, are always and anyway monotonous, a puppet. This new fisher price line has finally reproduced other types of animals because at the bottom there are not only bears, cats or dogs. In this case it is an otter. A sweet otter that will accompany your children during the nann, but not only. Thought obviously for the little ones does not exhaust but its works when the tannins grow. I tell you immediately that if I could give more than 5 stars to this puppet I would have given them, and now I tell us why: - the puppet is done well, adequate dimensions neither too big nor too small.. perfect for. the nannanna. Morbid even if it has a retro part of the electronics. I am delighted with the aesthetic that in the sounds that are not at all invadable. - does not simply have the function of the night light (which is also soft and does not disturbing) the power of the Lon. It is also funny to be able to breathed through the breathing. It is also in the same way of the music, and in the music, and in the music that it is not able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be used in the movement of the movement of the sounds, and is not to be able to use it is not at all of the sounds are not at all things that it is not intru for anything invad. - it is not invad. - it is not at all - it is not simply the function of the function of night light (which is not too much invad.

1352,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,16/10/2019,,"One of the most beautiful and tender puppets we have ever seen, really keeps the little one company, even during the night. The realization is very good, very soft and is rich in many functions including, the one that hit us most, is the simulation of the breath, really very realistic! In addition to the breath, this small otter, about 26 cm high, can simulate also the heartbeat, sounds of the womb, various sounds and lights, all selectable and adjustable for volume and intensity through an electronic device, powered by batteries (already included), which is inside the toy. It has a really relaxing and calming power, suitable for babies up to about 4/5 years of age, and what important, removing the electronic part, it is possible to wash the small otter in the washing machine! Currently it is sold at little more than 36 euro (October 2019) a price in my opinion more than reasonable to the quality and functionality of this toy of Fisher-Price, a purchase that I recommend with closed eyes!"
1353,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,28/10/2019,,"Excellent product arrived at the Merc house! It is a wonderful otter of Fisher-Price well made and soft. It has no external seams for the safety of our puppy, and has the tummy that moves and that lights up. crushing the tummy in fact will emit a few seconds of relaxing music for the child, this is more a function that will use 'the baby, because' if we go to open it from the back, we have many combinations to make. The first is the adjustment of the sound level, The second is the choice of the ringtone, being of so many white noises that reconcile the sleep, including the heartbeat. The third is the on/off of the light on the tummy while the last function provides only the light without audio. The back is velcro and does not have buttons or seams, and the batteries inserted are protected by a screw drawer, just for the maximum safety for the child."

Just press the tummy to see the puppet light up and emit a music, in addition to seeing the tummy swelling and deflating as if the otter were really breathing; in the back we find a large remote control that determines the functions both visual and sound. I can wash it in the washing machine (without the electric part). MY CONVINCE? Yes, it is a great gift idea for our children, who relax with the sweet breath of the puppet. Breath is the thing that has most affected me, in fact it seems to be real; an incredible effect. Also the puppet is very soft is well made, so even without using these effects remains a very tender object. If you want to save the box, we can use it as a cot for the small otter. PRO: excellent seams and finishes, visual effects and sounds. CONTACT: to date."

It is powered by 4 fleece stylus, included in the package, that you go to insert in the big command placed inside the otter. One thing I very welcome is the possibility to wash the plush in the washing machine, having the possibility to remove easily and quickly the electric part placed inside. Through the internal command you can set all the functions of the plush, from the type of sound emitted (noise of nature, white noise, breath, music melodies or heartbeat), the volume of the sound effects, the activation of the movement and lighting of the tummy. Once set to activate the plush will press the tummy and, for about 30 minutes, will continue with the program set. Unfortunately, there is a detector of tears that would make it really perfect, making it automatically activate in case of night awakening. The plush is still very nice and the combination of the many sounds make the most suitable!"

Of course we then go to feel strongly the product, even for a matter of safety, before giving them to a newborn or a small child we must understand if it can hurt or not, risk that it is excessive to say exist, but more padded would have been better."
1359,5,it,Not Verified,Italy,14/10/2019,,"I chose this game signed Fisher-Price, for my 1 year old son for the time of nap and nap. He liked it a lot and often embraces him even just for game. He likes to press on the tummy and see that it does up and down emitting sweet and relaxing sounds. The otter is very cute, soft hair and soft light grey color that does not cause any discomfort to the children. It produces sounds and musicettes relaxing and calming. It also produces rhythmic movements of the breath that help the child to calm down. You can listen for about 30 minutes: - white noises, - musicettes - sounds of the womb - heartbeat - and relaxing sounds Accompanied by the rhythmic movement of the bench of the Lontra. Also there is the possibility to adjust the volume of me case you want a smoother sound, the light can stay on or you can choose to turn it off. It works with 4pile format of Stylus A (R6) preferred by our own but it is definitely to be doing it already."

Then just insert the batteries to turn it into our son's best friend. Toy emits different varieties of sounds, including also the heartbeat (really fabulous!). The thing that amazed me the most is the fact that puppet makes the movement of ""exhale and breathe"" very realistically. Buying advice with my eyes closed!"

2,4,en,Verified,United Kingdom,4/1/2021,5,"I really like this and I'm glad I bought it for my daughter, who is 7 months, the only reason I haven't 5 starred it is because to change the settings you have to open the velcro and it sooo noisy that it disturbs her, seems counterproductive. If it had poppers maybe? If you preselect something you can just press its tummy to turn it on, so it's not the end of the world, still a lovely bedtime routine aid with plenty of different sounds and the breathing in and out tummy movements are a nice touch."

He obviously isn't playing with toys at the moment but he was smiling at the light and reaching out to touch it as well as grabbing and releasing the fur, and he stopped crying when the music was turned on. I love all of the options you can choose via the battery unit inside, you can have the light, music, white noise and breathing effect on or off you can also set it so the music goes off after 30 minutes. Great buy, good value for money and I highly recommend it."

66,3,en,Not Verified,United Kingdom,18/09/2019,9,"I’m so torn with this “toy”. I want to love it but I’m not sure if I do, hence giving it a mid-range rating.
It’s super cute, but not overly cuddly for a bedtime toy due to the power pack inside. The breathing function is really cute but the mechanism that pushes the tummy in and out is noisy and my daughter (16 months old) learnt very quickly that she could force it downwards so I’ve had to turn it off.
The buttons being on the inside means that it’s difficult to adjust any of the settings while you’re laying there with a baby possibly (probably) laying on one arm while you try to get them to sleep. It has a super stiff/scratchy Fisher Price label sticking out of the side, which could’ve been made from silky material as this is a comfort toy.
And the last negative - it’s really overpriced for what it is. It should be £25 at most!
Positives - as said, it’s really cute. You can wash it. The lullabies, breathing and heartbeat noises are all soothing and lovely and my daughter does really like it - which was the aim of buying it, so I guess it’s doing its job :)"
67,5,en,Not Verified,United Kingdom,30/11/2020,,this is  gorgeous it is for a gift  cant wait  to see it working proply
68,5,en,Verified,United Kingdom,28/01/2020,1,Great quality and so cute! Really snuggly for my 4 month old granddaughter to fall asleep with and very proactive when she is awake. Soothing tune and comforting breathing motion. She loves it!
84,4,en,Verified,Canada,28/05/2020,7,"I initially bought this for my 4month old son. I found it to be too big and heavy for him. I didn't' find the breathing mechanism helped at all for sleep. I ended up giving it to my 2.5-year-old who LOVED it.

What I like about it:
-Lighting - the otter emits a very soft, non-blue-light glow which I think is great and does not disrupt sleep.
-Battery life - I purchased this 3 months ago and I've had to replace the batteries once, and it is used nightly.
-very soft and cute washes well and still looks new.
-The older child loves it.

Drawbacks:
-I agree with previous reviewers that the breathing mechanism is quite loud. I can hear it from across the hallway when my daughter engages the button in the night. She doesn't seem to mind.
-While it's cute, I find it too large for younger babies, and even potentially dangerous for them in a crib. It's about the size of a cabbage patch doll.
-The settings are on the inside of the otter - so if you need to or want to change volume settings, you have to do so before the baby is in bed, or you might wake up the baby with the strong velcro closure.
- I also had a hard time getting the right settings working - it seems to be in demo mode at times...
-Small children can open the velcro on the back and pull out the light and breathing mechanism box. My daughter does this in the night sometimes and uses the inside mechanism as a flashlight. It's safe, but still annoying to have her remove it constantly, then ask me to put it back inside.

Overall, I think this is better suited to older babies or toddlers. My toddler's sleep has improved generally since this otter was introduced - she likes to take care of the otter and is comforted by the gentle glow and sweet songs."
100,1,en,Verified,Canada,12/2/2020,2,"I am very unhappy with this product, which is surprising since I am a huge Fisher-Price fan. I think I must have received a defective item because the breathing and movement options only stay on for about 3 seconds. I have tried replacing batteries but that did not help. The music stays on long-term, but I got it for the breathing and sounds. I would return the item however my husband disposed of all packaging materials before I had a chance to use it. Extremely disappointed and a waste of $40."
104,5,en,Verified,Canada,5/2/2020,4,"Amazing. Within 2 weeks of using this, my baby started sleeping by herself. She used to cry as soon as you put her down. The breathing and noise option work wonders. She loves it. The only bad thing is the button to turn it on is right on the front, so I have to turn it away from her or she'll turn it off"
130,5,en,Verified,Canada,24/11/2020,1,"I bought this for my little guy when he started his 8 month sleep regression. It was a bit of a long shot but I was desperate! Wow, it really helped! He seems to find it really soothing. I put on the white noise function and the tummy rising/falling, which he loves. 2 months later and it’s an integral part of his bedtime routine! The light is very soft, not a disturbance at all. Highly recommend."
158,3,en,Verified,Canada,13/01/2020,2,"The mechanism is a little noisy when “breathing” and if the tummy touches baby when the otter takes a breath, the gentle pressure it creates turns the otter off. But I love the sounds and the light, their is a volume control which is great. Overall I like it, just wish it wasnt as sensitive."
192,3,en,Verified,Canada,24/01/2021,,"Super cute toy and very soft. I like that you can choose all the setting to personalize the otter like the sounds, volume, light and so on. The only thing I dont love is when you have the belly function on it make sort of a robotic noise and if baby is holding it tightly it makes a clicking noise as it tries to move. Overall great toy but a little bit pricey for a musical stuffed animal."

1319,2,en,Verified,United States,1/10/2019,69,"The button to activate this is on the otter's tummy and very sensitive.  So, if my upset baby activates it, it turns itself off IMMEDIATELY at the first ""breath"" it takes because the tummy expands and presses the button against the cuddling baby.  If I turn it on and keep it away from him, it's a miracle. But he can never touch it or go near it or it will turn off IMMEDIATELY.  I have to watch these cry/calm/cry/calm dramas over the baby monitor and it's infuriating.  The Fisher Price ""Snug a puppy"" stays on for 15 minutes once pressed.  I thought it was annoying at first, ""Why can't I turn this thing off!?"" But now I get it.  This thing could be revolutionary but it amounts to junk because the very sensitive button is smack dab in the center of the glowing and moving tummy which, of course, is where any baby or toddler will want to touch and cuddle immediately.  Please make a new version that stays on!!!!!! And contact me or send it to me!!!!!!!! This thing is amazing when I play ""keep away"" with it but totally impossible to use for the purpose of self soothing.  Just mom initiated and overseen soothing. Not good for babies who can move on their own."

Oh my god. This is the cutest soother of my toy collection. And it is huge!
I'm a German toy collector and allthough I'm blind I immedeately fell in love with this otter. YouTube and technology makes it possible. I just had to have it! Unfortunately it didn't last long. To tell you the truth... Not even a year later and the motor is wornout so strong that it sounds like a mixture of a chainsaw and a drone. Not really soothing. And no joke, I couldn't find it anywhere online or in stores. But here!
The otter arrived earlier as planned and now it is guarded like the apple of my eye.
And yes I know that I'm actually a grown woman... But hey, think positive. It doesn't just help babies drifting off to dreamland. Anyway, I have to leave and sit myself in the garden to enjoy this calming music again. And again. And again. And... *snore*
(Okay, all jokes aside... I hope my grammar is not too bad.)"
1380,2,en,Verified,United States,2/1/2020,16,"To be honest I don't get all the excitement about this fuzz ball. I personally think its waaaay overpriced for the few functions that it has! A very good substitute toy for this one is an elephant which has star projector/music/heart beat from Walmart for $15, I got as baby shower gift which is much more on demand than this toy. I only like the music verity, its very soft and beautiful, but I hate that it has the light that you can't jut switch off, it turns on w/ music. Or you can't disable to ""breathing"". There is a very stiff mechanical device inside the body so you gotta watch this toy dropping on the floor. Would have returned it immediately if we haven't recycled the packaging box. We opened allot of baby toys that day and all the wrapping was placed in trash can. I ended up just re-gifting this toy to another person as is who had triplets."
1381,3,en,Verified,United States,14/02/2020,11,"I don't normally write reviews, but for this I will. Its cute, very soft. The night light and music is great. But the motor in it that makes it appear to be ""breathing"" which is the soothe factor for babies, honestly its pretty noisy....for $40. Kind of has a annoying hum to it. I think if you're going to pay 40$ for something like this it should be dead silent. Furthermore when I turned it on, it squeaked every time the belly went up, it was annoying. I actually took it apart, opened up the electronic box and found that the up and down part of the mechanism, is operated by a motorized wheel and and a tiny rubber belt. Not kidding, I WD-40'd that rubber belt. It took 2 hours to carefully put it all back together. It has to line up perfectly for the moving parts to work perfectly. There is no more squeak, thank god. The motor still has a quiet hum to it. Honestly my kid likes to turn it on an off and could care less to cuddle it. More so its a 40$ otter that entertains her and holds her pacifiers for her at night. Nice idea, but kinda overpriced."
1382,5,en,Verified,United States,2/6/2019,19,This little cutie is super soft and has a lot of functions. I thought it would be a hard toy since it does the fake breathing and would feel more like a robot toy but it’s actually soft and airy. The breathing sound and womb sounds are my babies favorite so far. I would definitely recommend this !
1383,5,en,Verified,United States,8/6/2019,11,"So, I saw this and then decided to buy it.  This toy soothes your newborn, and sometimes it provides the feeling of someone sleeping next to me baby, it plays music, has a heartbeat feature and it has this little fan!  My newborn likes or does not know it exists all I know is that he sleeps good and longer with it.  Not bad for the money"
1384,5,en,Verified,United States,30/07/2019,12,Our newborn loves this otter; she watches it until she falls asleep and if we don’t turn it on she will make a sound to let us know she wants it on. She has slept great with this otter; she prefers the white noise option with the light and breathing motion. I would recommend this soother to anyone! We are contemplating buying a second one just in case something were to happen to the one we have.
1385,3,en,Verified,United States,18/10/2020,2,"I wanted to love this but it’s too much maintenance to utilize. Definitely something parents can wait to buy when the baby is 8 months or older. I wish I didn’t have to open the back of the sloth every time I want to utilize everything the sloth does. I would also like it to be more stuffed/squishy to hold, it fall short on the cuddling factor. The box inside in huge and obviously hard. The sound and vibration has good payoff but user friendly it’s not unless you’re content just pushing the tummy to do 1 thing versus going to the back and opening it up over and over to utilize everything it can do. Btw the back opening is made of velcro. I think it’s over priced for the payoff factor of enjoyment that  is lacking with this toy to sooth a baby or toddler."
1386,5,en,Verified,United States,8/1/2021,2,"I purchased this late one sleepless night while I tried to get her sleep on her own in her bed. She didn't take to it until she was about 8 months old, but now it's MUST HAVE. She loves it. She'll gently touched the ""breathing"" stomach and lay there watching the glowing fade in and out. She likes the music best. What I love; all the options. There's heartbeat, swooshing sounds, music and you can control the loudness too. You could have no light on or no breathing if you wanted. It's fantastic. The only complaint I have is that if she pushes on the tummy or cuddles it too hard, it turns off. So, until she learns to push it back on...well, that's up to Mommy and Daddy. Overall though; highly recommend."
1387,2,en,Verified,United States,7/2/2021,1,"I was recommended to buy this by a family member who had purchased it for her kids.

Prior to purchasing I did read some concerning reviews and was a little skeptical as it’s pretty pricey but wanted to give it a chance. The toy is extremely soft and easy to set up to use. The functions allow you to choose music, a light which you can dim or brighten and breathing function. We used this combo for my 1 yr old and she would fall asleep watching it.

Less than a month later sadly I have to return it as the belly doesn’t move up and down for more than 10 seconds it’s also cuts off the music and light before I even leave her room. Pressing the belly back in I can hear a loud clicking sound that wasn’t there when initially turning it on. I hope this isn’t a ongoing issue as I’m unsure if I want to order another one."
1388,5,en,Verified,United States,11/8/2020,1,"This is a very sweet gift to comfort little ones. I had never seen the Soothe and Snuggle Otter before, but I bought it off of a baby registry and it is very very cute. It plays sounds/music, it has a soft light, and it even has a breathing motion which makes his belly move up and down. It also has controls which let you decide what you want on or off. The recipient loves it.Note: For safety reasons, do not leave it in the crib with the baby unattended, and when the baby is sleeping it should be removed from the crib altogether."
1389,4,en,Verified,United States,27/08/2020,1,He’s much bigger than I originally thought he would be! My daughter seems to like it ok but I’m not sure he was worth the amount of money. I’ve already had to replace the batteries and she’s only two months old - I don’t even use it every night! The snoring is a little creepy with the stomach movement but my daughter likes the heartbeat sound with the lighted belly most. I think if the price point was a little lower it would definitely be worth it.
1390,5,en,Verified,United States,13/02/2020,3,"A little expensive but my 1 yr old daughter loves it. It helped with her separation anxiety at this stage when going to bed. I like that you can choose which features are played together. You can have it breath with light on, breath with light off, don't breath but play music with light on, etc etc. Totally customizable in that sense.."
1391,5,en,Verified,United States,16/07/2020,1,"I bought this for my 6 yo who struggles with nightmares but after unboxing it I feel like I should buy one for each of my three kids and one for myself! It is unbelievably soothing and soft and quiet and adorable. It actually kind of feels like I’m holding a sleeping baby otter. The light is very soft, as is the music volume and pacing. So calming. Definitely good for not just babies."
1392,5,en,Verified,United States,13/04/2020,1,"My son loves his otter. He started using it at a week old and is 5 weeks now. We use it every night, it soothes him right down. He loves music and it has a very calming melody.  We can easily take it wherever we go. It's very soft! Love the breathing feature and that you can remove the otter part and throw it into the wash, we've had a few close calls so that's a bonus."
1393,4,en,Verified,United States,25/04/2020,1,"My kids love this and it's a great idea, but the motor is noisy. Which is annoying considering how it's kind of expensive! I wish they would just go all the way with this lovely thing and take the time to put in a quieter device for the stomach movement.My kids still use it every night and I love the soft lullabies. Not at all creepy or loud or obnoxious sounding. very nice, soft music."
1394,2,en,Verified,United States,24/03/2020,1,I bought this product months ago for when my son was born. The otter is very cute and I was excited to use it. However I just started using it and it turns on and shuts off after 15 seconds and gets stuck in the up position and won’t go back down and the music turns off. I really wanted to love this product.  It is so cute and soft but not worth the money. I returned the product
1395,4,en,Verified,United States,15/11/2020,,"Good product over all but little pricey. You can find a similar toy for about 25$. We had it now for about a month. The toy uses up the batteries quickly so make sure to stock up on them. My favorite sound is the white noise which soothes our colicky baby. The toy is pretty large, has volume control which is perfect. Good variety of sounds. The moving belly seems to be unnecessary and doesn’t make a difference for our baby. The glow feature is great. The material is soft. I gave it 4 stars because while the toy is awesome, I wish it had a sound self activation feature  for when baby cries and you can’t turn it on. I hope the manufacturer considers this. Our baby loves this toy and we take it with us everywhere."
1396,2,en,Verified,United States,22/01/2021,,"The sound machine and the breathing of the otter was great and would help my son fall asleep. It worked for about a week and then when you pushed the button it would make a noise for a couple seconds then stop. Agree with other reviews, that sometimes the “breathing” mode would make a loud sound but it wasn’t consistent. Unfortunately it seems this toy is not reliable in performing as described so hard to recommend this to anyone especially at its price point."
1397,5,en,Verified,United States,2/9/2019,2,"A bit pricey, but this was the only thing that helped put our baby to sleep for the first few weeks after he was home."
1398,3,en,Verified,United States,14/11/2020,,This feels nice and soft. My son didn’t like the music or the weight. He likes our dogs ikea lion better. I ended up taking the battery pack out. This is a very expensive night light that I had to take out of my son’s crib because he was stepping on the otter to lean over. I’ve removed the pack and he plays with as a stuffed animal.
1399,5,en,Verified,United States,28/08/2019,3,Omg this thing is so cute. I bought it as a gift for someone and they loved it. My daughter wasn’t pleased when she discovered it wasn’t for her! I may need to buy another based on the cute factor alone!
1400,1,en,Verified,United States,7/2/2020,3,"This thing was such a disappointment! It turns off after about a second of playing. It worked well a couple times in the beginning so I was hopeful it was just a glitch because I didn’t change the battery’s from when it was in its packaging, but no. It makes no difference. Waste of money"
1401,4,en,Verified,United States,22/11/2019,,"My little one loves this little otter, she immediately grabbed it and snuggled up with it! She’s currently 5 months. I love the breathing motion, my only gripe is that it’s in the front on the belly so if she squishes it too hard she turns it off. Then I have to press it to turn it back on again. Other than that, great product!"
1402,5,en,Verified,United States,4/1/2021,,"I love this little otter. It's adorable, soft, and the sound machine in it is great. It has a lot of configuration options and our 3 month old likes it. I usually leave it on the womb sounds while she naps which helps her to sleep, in my opinion, better. The sound goes for about 30 minutes which is great."

1404,3,en,Verified,United States,9/12/2019,,"Works well enough, and I like the features, but the ""breathing"" tiny makes a lot of mechanical noise and has started to squeak after about 6 weeks of use.

1405,2,en,Verified,United States,23/07/2020,1,"It’s super cute and this would be great, but the motor makes this loud squeaking sound and has the very first time I turned it on. Changed the batteries and that didn’t work. For the amount of money it was, I’m pretty disappointed."
1406,3,en,Verified,United States,24/02/2020,,"I love the otter my granddaughter had so I bought one on Amazon for my other granddaughter. I was excited to give it to her, but when it plays the expanding bag in the belly which mo es to imitate breathing makes a popping sound when it is in motion. The sound takes away from the soothing that the item is intended for.  I'm disappointed."
1407,5,en,Verified,United States,22/01/2021,,"It’s like a snuggle buddy! I practice infant safe sleeping, but before putting my son to bed, I turn on the otter. I will put lullabies on, the white noise, or sometimes the heartbeat. My infant son likes to be held to go to sleep, which sometimes can take awhile. As a single mother who had to work in the am, that is sometimes difficult. But by placing the otter next to him, with his pack, he starts to get sleepy and then I can eventually move him to his bassinet and let momma get some sleep! The quality is great, better than I’ve seen on the other products like this! I will be recommending this to other new moms!"
1408,5,en,Verified,United States,15/09/2019,1,"The otter is so cute and is very soft. However, it’s not as snuggly as you might think. I understand there needs to be hard parts to make the otter work. The top is soft though and my 5 month old loves it. Since we bought it he sleeps a lot better. I would definitely recommend it."
1409,5,en,Verified,United States,14/06/2019,6,My 2 month old loves this otter almost as much as I do. The lullabies and breathing motions are perfect and soothing.
1410,5,en,Verified,United States,16/12/2020,,We use this as the “sound machine” for our newborn and it’s amazing! As a professional musician myself I recognize all the songs that are being played and I love how most of the songs are classical themed music! The breathing setting helps calm him down and if he does happen to wake up the glow of the stomach will distract him and he will fall back asleep. This was a great purchase. It is well worth it!The otter itself is soft and the different fabric on the ears is really silky. I highly recommend this if you’re thinking about purchasing it as a gift for somebody or for your own baby.
1411,3,en,Verified,United States,22/11/2019,,"It is very cute and the light is nice and soft. The sounds are ok but dont play long enough. The ""breathing"" feature has a weird mechanical sound to it so didnt use it. I was excited to get this, but ultimately would not recommend"
1412,3,en,Verified,United States,8/7/2020,,"I returned this. I got it originally for the features and wondered if it’d be a mistake since the outside is not removable and washable. I was so surprised that it was not even for snuggling, it was so hard! For the money especially, I couldn’t understand why this child’s sleeping lovey was not in the least bit “snuggly” advertised."
1413,4,en,Verified,United States,9/4/2020,,I love the little otter...worked well to help baby sleep but after 4 months with minimal use the belly stopped working and the music would play for about 2 seconds and shut off. I love the music though and it will still play by pressing the play button in the back.
1414,5,en,Verified,United States,24/10/2020,,I bought this as a baby present.  I had to play with it a little before I gave it away though. It's so soft.  And such a cute little otter.

1415,4,en,Verified,United States,2/1/2020,1,I’ve been eyeing this soother since I got the notification that Fischer price was making it. My little one loves it so much! Only downside is that the settings are easily changed through the fabric in the back. Still adorable though!

1417,5,en,Verified,United States,28/09/2020,,My 10 month old really started fighting bedtime recently. I decided to get this over the glow warm or bs soothing animals and I'm glad I did! This does so much and you can control what is played as well as the volume.. It runs for a good amount of time too. It's helped me and my little guy when its comes to bedtime. Has even put my boyfriend to sleep. We love this adorable little sea otter! Id completely recommend this!!
1418,5,en,Verified,United States,16/09/2020,,This otter really does breath! Its a little hard but overall quality is great. The music it plays is soothing and plays for a long time so you don't have to get up every five minutes to turn it back on! It has a little glow light on its belly and my 9 month old seems to love it! Definitely too big for a newborn- 6 month old but worth it to sleep train your baby!
1419,5,en,Verified,United States,24/12/2020,,"I was wondering if it can soothe my baby girl's tension before sleep, so I play the music and found my baby fall asleep quickly when hearing the music. The volume can be adjusted easily and I can switch o white noise mode from the buttons on the otter's back. Although the price is kind of higher than my budget, it works great and is so cute that my baby and I feel joyful when the otter is playing music."
1420,2,en,Verified,United States,14/02/2020,,"Honestly I returned this. The reviews were great but for 40 bucks, this is like any other toy that makes sounds to my baby. It didn’t phase him and like what other reviewers said, if you lightly touch the stomach it stops playing music and stuff so it just sat next to him... eh"

1431,5,en,Verified,United States,18/12/2019,,Use for infant. A little confusing at first but she really loves the multiple functions and needs them to soothe when she is fussy.  A nice safe alternative when they have to lay in bed.

I have changed the batteries multiple times so it's not an issue with having dead or dying batteries. Any time tummy part is touched it shuts off. Very frustrating. I love the light up feature. Wish it stayed on. Waste of money. Maybe I have a defective one ?

1526,4,en,Not Verified,United States,9/6/2019,14,"This is charming.  We all love this toy.  The otter is so cute, and the breathing is adorable.  There’s a little mechanical sound I don’t like.  There are four sounds the otter makes, including something that is supposed to sound like when baby was still in the uterus, but no ocean, which is our favorite on the Sleep Sheep.One major concern, however, is the otter’s arms,  my 3yo demonstrates how they can act as handcuffs for a young child and - even though I can’t say for certain that this would be problematic - it strikes me as potentially dangerous.  So buyer beware..."
1527,5,en,Not Verified,United States,4/7/2019,11,"At first I was hesitant about getting this because I thought it was weird and creepy but after seeing other reviews and hearing from people who swear by it I decided to give it a chance. I’m so glad I did! It’s surprisingly very soft and cuddly even with the big electronic contraption inside. It’s so convenient that I can just take the electronics out and throw it in the wash and it comes out just as soft as before. I love the colors and the little fish detail fabric on the tail, super cute. The belly movement is still a little off putting to me but it really did soothe our newborn. I appreciate all the different sound options and that the belly can be a little night light. We don’t use this every time baby sleeps because we don’t want our little one becoming dependent on something but every now and then when we do use it for calming baby it’s been a life saver. It makes for a great on-the-go noise machine as well for our trips to grandmas house. We call ours Otto :)"
1528,4,en,Not Verified,United States,27/06/2019,2,"The Fisher Price Soothe n Snuggle Otter is absolutely adorable! This little guy is a welcome addition in our home.
The material is plush and incredibly soft. Press the belly and it plays classic lullabies like twinkle, twinkle little star plus other soothing music that is sure to calm and relax your little one. His belly glows through a seashell shaped piece while the abdomen area rises and falls gently as if he's really breathing.
All the different features are easily accessible through velcro pieces on his back. The buttons are all conveniently labeled with little pictures so you won't have any problems adjusting the volume up and down or turning off the glowing light feature. I really like how you're able to customize the features to whatever your baby prefers. For example, you can have the music playing but disable the light and breathing features OR have the lights on with the music but shut off the moving belly.
One of the first things I noticed was how heavy this toy is. Not heavy for an adult but my 18 month old can just barely hold it up. The weight is the result of the gigantic battery which fills up most of the inside. While the outside material is cozy and soft, the huge rectangular shaped battery makes it awkward to cuddle. I can't imagine any child snuggling up with this comfortably since it would be like lying with a plush covered brick.
My daughter (who is 18 months old) was not initially impressed with the otter. She hardly even glanced at it. I ended up putting it beside her diaper changing area and the soothing lights and sounds are now a wonderful distraction when I need her to be still. This also would have been a great toy to have when she was an inconsolable infant. I think babies under one are far more likely to enjoy this toy, compared to older toddlers who may get bored easily.
High quality, just like most Fisher Price toys but I'm giving 4 stars because I wouldn't describe this as snuggly."
1529,5,en,Not Verified,United States,1/7/2019,2,"First off-- this is seriously the most adorable little thing I've ever seen! It's also so, so soft and cuddly. I would be lying if I said that I didn't think of testing it out myself before giving it to my daughter. Outside of the apparent aesthetic appeal (who can deny the cuteness of an otter) of this little otter the features are amazing. With the breathing motion of the otter (tummy rising and falling) I thought that it may feel too mechanical, however, that was not the case. I love the fact that you can utilize lights, sound, and motion and customize based on what features best work with your kiddo. Win here: you can remove the mechanical piece to throw the otter body into the washing machine!

This would make a great gift for a baby shower or for a new parent!

UPDATE: now that my daughter has had this for awhile, I can happily say she loves her otter! It is in bed with her every single night. In the morning before she is fully awake I have caught her pressing the tummy to turn on the sound and lights and laying by her new little friend calmly. Definitely a win!!"
1530,5,en,Not Verified,United States,12/5/2020,,"This little thing is *such* a great gift for expecting moms. It's sizeable enough that it won't get lost, it's soft and fuzzy, and the heartbeat is lovely. Honestly, my 13-year-old wanted to keep it forever and ever, and was super disappointed when I said we were giving it to a friend. However, said friend is a close one, so she gets to play with it regularly anyway. ;) The batteries last a reasonable amount of time, the sound isn't *too* loud, and it really is comforting. Because it lays flat, it can be put either in the crib, or on a shelf right above it with no issues. The light isn't super bright, either, but it's just enough that in the darkness of the room, you have a pleasant glow that won't KILL your eyeballs if you walk in from another dark room in the middle of the night.Overall, this really was a great gift, and if I knew anyone having a little one, I'd be happy to give this again!"
1531,5,en,Not Verified,United States,11/7/2019,3,"I am in complete shock at the overall greatness of this product. It is so cute, super soft and just the right size for an infant.My daughter still has minor Colic and ever since I got this toy for her she has been falling asleep, and staying asleep much quicker and longer. The breathing feature along with the heartbeat sound gives her just enough comfort to doze off without everyone constantly having to hold her.The lullabies keep her dozed off and the little comfort light lets me know how everything is going. I wish I would have had this toy months ago. This will be my new go-to shower gift!"
1532,4,en,Not Verified,United States,22/06/2019,1,"My infant son won't sleep without me near. I wanted something that might help him fall asleep without me. This cute and soft otter is just what I was looking for. I love that this has the rising and falling chest feature. It's the perfect thing to make him feel like he's falling asleep with me. This also features soft, pleasant music or white noise or snoring. It's really nice that you can choose which option you prefer as well as have control over how loud or soft the sounds are. My only complaint is that all of the 'noise' options seem to last longer than just the simple rise and fall and I'd rather my son not get used to having sounds in order to fall asleep. That one complaint aside, I also love that this is machine washable when you pull the remote out of the back. And amazingly, I find my older kids enjoying sitting and holding this otter too."
1533,5,en,Not Verified,United States,23/06/2019,1," Fisher-Price's Good Night Luv Loubout is a super cute, super soft, super awesome little stuffed toy for babies!

Place the little otter in the crib next to your little one and press play. The little otter will lure your baby to sleep as its soft belly lifts and lowers in rhythm.

The otter also plays music and lights for up to 30 minutes.

Summary:
(1) Musical otter soother with ""breathing"" motion for babies
(2) engage your baby's senses of sight, hearing, and touch
(3) mimics the rhythmic motion of your breathing to naturally soothe your baby
(4) customizable up to 30 mins of music, sounds, and soft lights
(5) super soft fabrics
(6) machine-washable (with electronics removed)"
1534,5,en,Not Verified,United States,5/7/2019,1,I was very surprised when we received this to see that the otter breathes just like it would in real life while it is playing music or one of the sounds that it plays.  My daughter loves sleeping with this in her pack n play and feeling it takes breaths and the music is the perfect volume so it isn't too loud or soft and it helps to soothe her to sleep.  It also has a little light in it's stomach which is great too because it is very soft and not meant to wake up your little one.  I am so very happy with this toy and so is my daughter.  Great item to have to help your little one sleep in their own safe space and still think that  someone is next to them.
1535,5,en,Not Verified,United States,10/7/2019,1,"My LO LOVES this little otter. She cuddles up with it and squeezes it. She seems to be soothed by the sounds and the breathing motion. I was nervous she might have found this scary, because something things that move make her cry, but this guy didn't! My LO just turned a year, and I can foresee her using this for at least another year, if not longer!"
1536,5,en,Not Verified,United States,6/7/2019,,"This is a nice soothing sound machine/stuffed animal. There are buttons inside the back under the velcro. The options are for its ""breathing"" motion, a light on its tummy, music, or sound. After you make the selection you simply press its stomach and it will do them all, but for each a separate amount of time. It will do 30 minutes of music/ sounds, 10 minutes of breathing motion,  and 15 minutes of the light. The nice thing about this is the otter is machine washable, you just take the electronic unit out."
1537,3,en,Not Verified,United States,19/06/2019,2,"My first impression was that it didn't really look like the picture and that something looked wrong with it.  When it started breathing, that was all I needed.  It's just too creepy for me.  The kids don't seem to care, but it's not something I would pick up and say ""cute""."
1538,5,en,Not Verified,United States,22/06/2019,1,"I just might have slept with it (since my husband doesn’t allow live pets in our bed). But she loves it and I’m teaching her that she can only have it at bedtime. That way she has something she loves to help her sleep. And help her it does! When she’s tired, all it takes is about five minutes of her listening or feeling the otter breathe and she’s asleep. This comes highly recommended!"
1539,5,en,Not Verified,United States,29/07/2019,,"My LO has had trouble sleeping in his own crip since he was born , I never thought I would be able to transition him easily .

1540,5,en,Not Verified,United States,14/07/2019,,Oh my this is simply adorable.  It simulates soft noises like baby would hear in the womb.  The animal breathes deeply and his tummy rises and falls while he’s deep asleep and you hear the sweet noises.  Soothes baby.  Wonderful shower present.

75,3,es,Verified,Spain,26/12/2019,35,"It is a very practical toy, my baby is almost three months old and it is ideal for you not to feel alone in the crib when we lay her down.The stick that it has is that it lasts half an hour and that to change from melody to sounds you have to open a Velcro that is in the back and that makes a lot of noise and the baby wakes up."
91,5,es,Verified,Spain,13/08/2019,15,This perfect works great and my baby loves it.
93,5,es,Verified,Spain,16/10/2020,4,"Above all I liked how smooth it is and the fact that it can be separated from the washing device (unbelievable error but today there are still toys for babies that cannot be washed...) so a great point in their favor, and more in the situation we are living... (you fall in the street and if you can not wash maybe you think until you throw it away... :-SThe device is like a controller (you can see it in the photos), you have options for almost everything! A pity is true, I have read in other comments that asked to record the voice and no, it does not include that option, although for my part I do not consider it essential.In general I am very happy with the otter, the only defect I see it is that the babies take everything to the face and the Velcro that closes the back is very rough and rigid, I think that another type of Velcro or a zipper would have been better option. Still I recommend it, I am sure that even if it stops working, it will remain one of their favorite stuffed animals :)"
96,4,es,Verified,Spain,5/12/2019,5,"It turns on by pressing the belly, but to turn it off you have to open the Velcro from behind and press two buttons at the same time, which is somewhat uncomfortable.Although if you press the gut it also ends up turning off, but in the instructions indicate that the way to turn it off is in the back buttons, so I don't know if it will spoil it in the gut.The movement of the breath makes quite noise.However, the doll is very sweet and with the light low or off it is very relaxing.The sounds are very good and you can regulate the volume."
97,5,es,Verified,Spain,27/07/2019,7,"Spectacular! Our baby of almost 8 months, who has always had a hard time falling asleep, loves and relaxes so much!!! The sound of breathing is the one we like the most, along with the light and movement of tummy. It has become an essential for the time to go to sleep!"
98,3,es,Verified,Spain,26/11/2019,6,"We bought it for our 4-month-old baby, who has a hard time falling asleep, and we only get him to do it on the chest in bed, and the truth is that he has not listened to it, nor does it happen to sleep, nor to play, it strikes him zero. The toy itself meets all the features it announces, it is adorable, warm and soft, but in our case, it does not fulfill its purpose of relaxing and sleeping the baby."
103,5,es,Verified,Spain,13/07/2020,2,"My daughter is delighted and at last it seems that we get her to sleep alone with her otter friend! She is two years old.The teddy is very soft, the musics are nice and in a short tone, perfect to help relax (to me relax, hahahaha).She has a light also soft, that is enough to not stay in the dark, but she doesn't see much to get out of bed.The tummy makes a move to go up and down that definitely hypnotizes and that also helps her relax!It has been a successful purchase!At first it seemed a little expensive, but we like it very much and, the main thing, is helping the little girl fall asleep alone! :)"
110,5,es,Verified,Spain,30/03/2020,2,The best gift we could give our baby. Until three months he suffered from colic and has been his cot to date. He sleeps caressing him. At night we put the melody together with The Light of the tripita that goes up and down and sometimes the function of the heartbeat I think it will be his teddy for years.Like everything is improveable; the manufacturer would suggest that the engine (inside the teddy) of all functions be reduced and so the teddy was soft and manageable. I fear that as soon as the baby grows and can manipulate it we will have to remove it because it is very heavy and in that case we will fill it with foam but our BEBE is FELIZ with its otter so highly recommended as a gift
131,5,es,Verified,Spain,1/11/2019,3,"It is beautiful, soft and original, with the tummy that lights up and goes up and down as if breathing. It has 2 sounds (the typical music and the one that mimics the heartbeat and the breath) and has a very nice packaging to give away, besides it washes very well..."
142,4,es,Verified,Spain,16/05/2020,1,"For my Fisher Price is a brand of absolute confidence. Its products are safe for children, my children have never managed to disarm any; they also last for many years with their functions and appearance intact.And also they are fun and entertaining for children.For those reasons I chose this toy as a gift for my granddaughter.It is also a cute teddy, better than what comes out in the photo.I don't put 5 stars because it hasn't given me time to check its durability.I hope the brand hasn't lowered its quality, like many other brands and we continue to enjoy its quality."
147,5,es,Verified,Spain,11/7/2019,5,My daughter loves the noise of the heart beating and stays fried
154,5,es,Verified,Spain,8/12/2020,,"The product is good for my son who is not even two months old, it usually costs him to sleep and I thought about this stuffed animal, because it has colic and with the sound of the heart it falls asleep. Since it must remind him when it was inside me and with the music it relaxes. The only drawback is that to change it you have to open it and it makes noise I leave it open so you don't have to move it much. Otherwise it is fine, he still doesn't realize what it is but I hope that then he plays with it.Now that I have tried it a few days the batteries don't last anything..."
162,4,es,Verified,Spain,10/2/2021,,"It costs my little one a lot to fall asleep and I bought it to try, something else.The sounds are great and they are heard very well.The light is enough to not bother.The only stick that would put it is that, the sound of the belly mechanism is heard a lot at night. Otherwise, my daughter sleeps looking up and down the belly with the light on. It is relaxing."
178,5,es,Verified,Spain,23/05/2020,,"The product came to me defective, the music stopped in a few seconds. I talked to the seller and did the replacement at the moment. I recommend the product, since I have a baby that resists to sleep and with this otter relaxes, between the relaxing songs that it brings and the breath that it simulates. I recommend the seller, has responded very quickly."
190,4,es,Verified,Spain,17/10/2020,,"It is a toy that we want to use since it is a baby, because the songs are very tender and sweet, it also has choice of heart beats or sounds from inside the utero. It is pleasant to the touch, but the apparatus inside is very large if it is not covered enough to be very soft."
213,5,es,Verified,Spain,2/11/2020,,"Great product.It has a super touch aroused and my 5-month-old baby loves it and helps him sleep.It has relaxing sounds, different melodies, a dim light and the belly moves it providing you with the peace of mind you need to sleep.The bad thing is that to change the sound you have to open the Velcro and select it by hand, which makes it a little cumbersome.For my baby and for us 5 stars."
217,5,es,Verified,Spain,27/09/2019,2,It’s great! We love it! It’s great that I have so many different sounds! My daughter sleeps right away with the nannyes and touching her belly! It’s been a good idea to buy it!
218,4,es,Verified,Spain,29/10/2020,,"Get our baby not to cry at bedtime, the first day he cried a little alone and now nothing, it seems that when he sees it he already relaxes. He can put the music quite low and lasts 30 minutes, for now it is enough time for him to fall asleep and not wake up at the end. The movement of the belly makes quite noise but does not seem to bother him"
226,5,es,Verified,Spain,25/12/2020,,I liked it very much. It has several options if you want to put them together or separately.My son liked it very much for saying something bad has a very large sailboat behind and if you want to open it to change any option can the baby wake up
230,5,es,Verified,Spain,27/12/2020,,"Ideal gift for parents who have recently had a Peque. Touch is incredibly soft and its sound, movement and light help (at least in my case) to fall asleep when the baby wakes up at night; especially useful from the age of 4 months, when (in some cases, like mine) there is a change in the baby's sleep pattern."

Easy to use. I do not give 5 stars for the rough and noisy Velcro, if you want to access the inside of the teddy. Otherwise it is perfect."
236,5,es,Verified,Spain,28/12/2020,,"The otter is soft, it breathes, it imitates the sound of the beating of the heart, it has music and light. All this with self-turning off. It worked perfect for two days to sleep our daughter but no longer works, although it is not the fault of the product."

337,4,es,Verified,Spain,5/2/2020,,"My baby has loved it, the music relaxes him a lot, although personally the light seems excessive to me. Breathing makes a little noise, but soon only the music sounds."

But on the contrary for babies that mobility is scarce is a very good teddy, since the sounds that they produce can calm the baby, highlighting the sound of the mother’s heart, is really achieved. The teddy is soft, detachable, and at the same time can be washed without any problem. Mattel’s teddyney is ideal to place it in the crib and calm the little one, so that his rest is excellent. Of course say that the teddy bear is a nurse that is asleep. My experience with this product has been positive."

He arrived teddy in the morning and we tried it at noon and we are delighted! After 10 minutes where he was fighting against himself because he did not want to sleep, he had lost the fight, heh.. and in the evening he blabs briefly but sleeps in 10 minutes.

1327,4,es,Not Verified,Spain,8/9/2019,2,"It is not a bear, it is an otter, which I think is one of the most tender wild animals. The box of the stuffed animal imitates a small crib, the presentation could not be better. From the beginning it invites to “achucharlo”. The breathing effect is very realistic, and it can be configured at different speeds. The center of the tripita is illuminated with a yellow light, and the rag tail comes with some prints of goldfish. You have it available in,"

It transmits a lot of tenderness and will be perfect to camp him the first months of life. The doll has light and music, besides movement that mimics the breath, it is very pleasant touch also you can wash it by removing the electric mechanism. It has a timer of 30 minutes and you can control the volume, something that is very appreciated in these toys, since not all can control the volume and in some cases it is very high. The movement of the breath sure that hypnotic, I think it is a perfect gift. Greetings."

The presentation is also very pretty, since the box simulates a cunita. • It is completely unisex. • It is very colorful for gift, since the teddy comes to the eye and can even be tested, since it has demonstration stacks on it. In our case the whole set comes protected with a transparent plastic bag so that it does not get dirty before it is released. • The fabric is very soft and pleasant. • We love that you can very easily separate the teddyney from the mechanism to be able to wash it in the washing machine. All the interactive stuffed animals should be like this! • Pressing the tripita, it lights up and puffs up as if you breathe, calmly and paused. The effect is very accomplished. • We can select very soft music (nanas), sounds of nature and white noise (beats, whispers...). It automatically turns off after 30 minutes. • We can choose the intensity of our light and volume of the music and sounds. • We do not even make us look very good."

Toy never tested before and unknown to us at home, the model is an otter, I have checked it before giving it to my son and it does not present cutting parts, nor pieces that can be released and our children swallow them very important thing. It is of a very soft touch, it is washable both by hand and machine, the size is the right, it is unisex is valid for boy or girl, we can take the electronic part of the part that is not without problems, the batteries carry their safety screws that will make our children unable to pull them out. It emits sounds, it makes as if you are sleeping, the belly moves, we can illuminate it the belly or not and above all helps our baby relax and make you sleep."

It has different types of music and relaxing sounds that we can choose together with the lights and the movement of the belly, the going up and down of this next to the noise that mimics the breath are very accomplished. All this can be selected by means of buttons hidden in the back by means of Velcro. It works by means of 4 AA batteries. On the other hand, the mechanism is easily removed so that we can wash the part of the cloth.In addition, if we want to give it away, the presentation is careful because the otter is lying in a box that simulates a crib and remains very cute."
1338,4,es,Not Verified,Spain,14/08/2019,1,"Hi friends  amazon. When you click the otter print of the belly you light a warm yellow light and your belly goes up and down, It sounds a piano-like muse with some variations that are changed from the electronic unit that is inside the otter. I had to open it from behind to get to the unit and there you find all its control buttons, Volume Control, Music, Light and Heart Beats. It works with 4 batteries of the type AA/LR6. It is somewhat messy to be opening the otter whenever you want to change music or the rest of its parameters, I would have preferred a remote control or that its buttons were on the outside. That of opening the otter whenever I want to change something bores me a little. The otter is great, but its electronic unit ends boring you with time."
1339,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,10/8/2019,1,"A teddy very pleasant to the touch and to the ear since its melodies are not like those of the whole life, strident, but they are pleasant to listen to. The effect ""breathing"" is very good because while vibrating, the teddy goes ""inchanting"" the belly, creating a sensation that the little one finds pleasant and relaxing. The volume is adjustable as well as whether or not to turn on the little lights and/or to turn on or not the effect ""breathing"". A very soft ""companion"" of naps for our little ones. The price seems high, but if we compare with others of worse quality and similar price is resolved the question of whether it is expensive or not :) A product highly recommended, the little one will love."
1344,4,es,Not Verified,Spain,21/02/2020,,"One of the biggest problems that we have when it comes to sleeping a baby is to calm down for it, and one of the best solutions is music, and if it goes with a soft teddy and it mimics human breathing, then much better, and that's what we have in this teddy in the form of an otter, it's very soft so it doesn't damage the baby's skin, it has music that relaxes it, and it works by imitating the breathing, so it's especially thought for babies since its birth. The teddyney is small and has up to eleven sensory functions, in this way, besides relaxing the baby, it helps him to move more and better, it helps him to develop the view and the touch, and especially with the ears, it has the possibility to program up to thirty minutes of music and in the area of the belly it carries a small soft light to entertain the baby more. It works perfectly, relax the baby and we are calmer, it has a very good price and it is of great quality, so I do advise it."
1360,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,6/9/2019,,"We are looking at a toy for the little ones to use when sleeping in the crib. It is an ideal teddy for newborn babies as it performs breathing movements that will help babies to learn, as well as to relax. Thanks to this teddy the little ones will be able to encourage both the sight, the ear and the touch. We will be able to customize the music we want, as well as the light intensity up to 30 minutes. The teddy fabric is very soft and has no small pieces so without any doubt it is an excellent gift for any baby who has just been born. The current price is around 40 euros, given the brand, the quality and the polyvalence it seems a really recommendable purchase. In short an ideal teddyney to start encouraging the little ones, help them to sleep and learn to breathe. an excellent purchase."
1361,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,9/8/2019,,"My baby has it totally hypnotized, it is a baby otter of the softest, it is quite big and achuchable, the feeling of breathing added to the children's melodies is ultra relaxing even for my haha I think this toy is going to be a success, to me and my baby has us in love. It has several buttons in the back to control the level of volume, light, and the options of melodies, sounds (beats, nature, breathing) and the mechanism of breathing of the tripita, this last point in my case is giving me problems, you listen a lot the motor (thing that is not relaxing anything) in the video I have put the melody to the low volume so that the noise that makes is heard, on the other side I stop working the motor and at the time it works again but it seems that it jumps the breath and makes a small noise when I jump, if it happens to you it can also happen that it is a bad part of series and not an isolated defect, in any case you will not have problem in Amazon to solve it quickly. Nor do I understand very simple button because you sometimes I don't even make a lot of melodies melodies melodies very short and I am."
1364,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,19/08/2019,,"Very soft teddy otter, although if you squeeze the body you notice the box with the mechanism. It seems to me a very sweet toy, you squeeze his belly and it starts to sound a very soft and pleasant music, in addition to a small light that is lit in his navel and, best of all, the doll starts to breathe, and that relaxes a lot. Besides, the noise of the mechanism looks like the purling of a kitten. It is an ideal doll to give to a newborn, although I think it can use any child a little older at bedtime, because it accompanies, and many times they are afraid of the darkness. The presentation has very much liked, the box imitates a cunita in which is the nurse sleeping belly up."

Super soft and pleasant to the touch, has a light in the belly and charity relaxing melodies that work. It understands breathing, heart beats, relaxing music... and above the central part moves like real breathing. It is very accomplished and really has conciliatory effects of sleep. It is not magic art, but it is true that it encourages its rest and with it ours. Musical tones its can regular and it is totally serene, nothing excessive. Recommended, it is certainly something expensive to be a teddyney but it is worth trying if the baby gives bad nights. If it solves it or reduces it for little it will have been worth it. It can be washed in the washing machine taking out for it the electronic component of its interior, do not forget."

It includes options of 30 minutes of music and sound effects and lights to facilitate the baby's sleep. The sound volume is adjustable. It works with 4 batteries of type AA 1.5 volts that are included. Manufacturing is Chinese, with good finishes and good quality. Given its sound options, you have to try which one is most pleasing to the baby. I think it is a good choice."
1367,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,12/9/2019,,"This is a teddy doll shaped like an otter from Fisher Price. I say it is a teddy type because it is soft and very soft but it has an interior device for lights, sounds and movement that make it a hair harder than a teddy one and that weighs a little bit more. In the middle of the belly it has a dim light and also emits up to 30 minutes of relaxing music. Now, what I found more beautiful is that the belly of the otter makes a move as if it were breathing, it is adorable! I find it a beautiful doll for a baby, I gave it to the baby of some friends and loved it, and the truth that the baby stays very calm when they put it on."

We can also choose that the belly simules or not breathing. And all this is selected with buttons that are in the back, and that are then hidden with a Velcro closure. It is a very nice doll and for the moment seems to have liked the baby."
1371,5,es,Not Verified,Spain,9/8/2019,,"The otter teddy is very well thought out. I have a device that helps them to sleep but it is not the same. This one being teddy shape and being so soft, babies can interact with it and put it close to sleep with it. It has different sounds: breathing, beats, white noises and soft melodies that sound for half an hour in a row. The volume can be adjusted, but the high tone is not excessive. Also, one thing that relaxes them is that it is swollen and unsinks the belly imitating the breath. The fabric can be removed and washed in washing machine without problem. I am very happy with this product, it is very well thought out."

It’s quite well achieved, the truth. It has different musquitas and sounds, which can be regulated both in time and volume. It has a little light that is also soft and not bothersome. As for the result, it does relax the baby and leave him well asleep. We’ve also tried it with a 3 year old girl and, even if she’s older, she loved it and fell asleep with her in her bed. It works."

69,4,de,Verified,Germany,23/08/2019,105,"Update: After half a year, the engine in the belly has slowed down. The weak buzzing from the beginning is now as loud as a mix of toy drone and model plane and drowns out the quietest volume level. Very unpleasant. Fortunately, I quickly found a replacement (at the time it was sold out almost everywhere...) and because brains are a funny thing, my now needs both otters to fall asleep. One to Anguck (or scare someone with knatterknatterbrumbum) and one to be cute and fall asleep. And jaaaa, strictly speaking, I'm out of age. But only quite, strictly speaking... the functions of the otter are quickly explained. He plays music, lights up and lifts and lowers his belly, which is supposed to hug so half realisticly your and my breathing. Overall, he plays eight tunes (I believe?). Many of them I don't know and were probably produced by FP itself, the others are my bonny lies over the ocean, Mary a little lamb, beautiful can relax and twin know how to beat the other songs. If you don't do not want to play."
70,5,de,Verified,Germany,27/01/2020,71,"So our son got his otter with 5.5 months and immediately grinned. He gets him during the day as a sleepmate and then draws him affectionately towards himself. Although it was still quite difficult for him he also lifted up to cuddle with him. Of course it is dangerous to let him sleep with it unattended at the age (danger of suddenly child death). But this is well known for all cuddly animals, blankets and pillows. The music is now after a month still not annoying but still really sweet. However, breathing is a tick too loud for me, but does not bother at all when falling asleep because it is regular. I just don't find it nice. The staggered switch it off I find great: first breathing, then light, then music. Also, that the volume can be regulated is great, because it is quite meh on his head. Many toys for babies are dangerously loud. Here no longer. In fact, he does not get any more at night (we had it taken away after falling asleep anyway). First, because he doesn't sleep with it again."
71,3,de,Verified,Germany,18/11/2019,66,"Visually totally cute! The fur is also super soft, BUT unfortunately the cuddly toy is not well lined, so you can feel the edges of the engine very clearly. For cuddle the toy is not suitable. Besides, the engine is extremely loud, if you activate the breathing movements.Did it buy as a gift for a friend and unfortunately have a Bachache when giving away. I sewn extre an additional padding, which I wrap around the engine so that the edges are not so hard... I don't know why you design such a sweet and really great toy and then save on the padding and the volume shortly before closing..."
73,5,de,Verified,Germany,27/08/2019,49,"Without this cute little animal, our child can no longer fall asleep.The long playing time is advantageous because you don't have to activate the music clock all the time. Parents also sleep quickly a good sound quality. Definitely worth their money."
78,5,de,Verified,Germany,2/8/2019,25,The delivery was fast and it is easy to use as we have seen batteries can be changed quickly and easily.Our son is now 6 weeks old we always had difficulty getting him to sleep. We got the stuffed animal in the morning and tried out at noon and are thrilled!!! After 10 min where he himself was fighting because he did not want to sleep he had lost the fight and also in the evening he blabs briefly but fell asleep within 10 min
79,5,de,Verified,Germany,28/08/2019,25,"The otter is really very sweet and fluffy. We always use it in the evening as part of our sleeping ritual, with the aim to fall asleep at some point without breastfeeding. My son is now 7 months and likes to cuddle with him. The volume control is very good, the melodies very pleasant. We currently use mainly the sound as in the womb."
80,5,de,Verified,Germany,28/08/2019,24,"We've already tested some musical clocks, this is in our opinion the best!!! Very many functions, the volume is super good to regulate, pleasant sounds and melodies. It is not necessary to pull up with a band but the otter is activated by pressing on the belly. We bought 2 for both children and are enthusiastic. Absolute purchase recommendation!"
81,5,de,Verified,Germany,16/09/2019,20,We have a similar cuddly friend of the much more expensive variant. I have to say that our otter is simply awesome. Clean soothing tones. Even the mama sleeps well with it. Moving the belly up and down is fascinating and soothing too alike. The weak light in the belly of the otter is wonderful. All in all a great invention of Fisher Price and highly recommended.
83,3,de,Verified,Germany,5/12/2019,9,"As has been mentioned before, the frame in which the engine is in is not reasonably padded, so that you can feel the hard edges. I find it impractical that you can only make adjustments when you open the back part. It might be more practical if you press at the foot or at the ear to handle certain sounds. I find, like some others, that the engine works far too loudly, so that it overtones the sounds and completely irritates them. In the technical development of today it is certainly possible to develop a better engine performance. I expected more from Fisher-Price for the price."
87,2,de,Verified,Germany,11/11/2019,9,"The otter looks very cute, the little night light on his belly is practical for the night and as a music box I find it not bad, because the melodies are very nice and soothing.However, I bought it first of all, because I thought that these breathing noises and lifting and lowering of the belly could be calming and helping to fall asleep.My child (6 months) first laughed and then she found it kind of stupid.The engine is very loud, because you don't hear the rest of the noises well anymore, unless you set the volume relatively high. My personal opinion is that this part is not so helpful in ""sleep problems""."
92,5,de,Verified,Germany,26/08/2019,11,Otti is so sweet....has helped to fall asleep super. Everyone immediately got into Otti....just golden.It is definitely worth his money.I would buy again and again.
95,3,de,Verified,Germany,22/08/2020,3,"The melodies are very soothing and not as intrusive as with other products. Also the light and the snoring function of the otter are quite pleasant.However, there are also some negative points: As a cuddly animal, for example, the otter is not suitable at all and it is a mystery to me how in some reviews the talk of ""cuddly"" can be.The fabric is soft, however, the inner life of the stuffed animal is so huge and hard that it really can't be cuddly.The huge Velcro fastener on the back of the otter is also very disturbing and can be opened very quickly.In addition, the motor of the breathing function is so loud and annoying that it is not used in us at all. Therefore only 3 stars for this sloping aid."
99,5,de,Verified,Germany,15/10/2020,2,"I got the otter at the beginning of January for my daughter, who was 1 month old at that time, now she is 10 months old. She was a writer and only let herself be calmed by white noise. At the beginning I was not so excited about the otter because he was too quiet for my daughter, he did not come to scream against her - we had to use a cell phone app. Since she is about 4 months old, however, the otter is in permanent use. We always use the functions noise and light. Every time she wakes up at night, I turn on him, the very small light source helps me to quiet (sleep in the family bed and silently lying down). And it helps her to fall asleep again. She wakes up very often in the night, sometimes every 30-60 minutes, so the otter is in some nights in the ""dauerbeinsatz"" of the only manko: The otter runs exactly 30 minutes, but then goes out. And exactly at the moment she wakes up because the noise stopped and at the time in the sleep cycle she has arrived again at light sleep. Therefore she doesn't always wait until she wake up the Otter."
101,3,de,Verified,Germany,8/12/2019,2,"Since we have been looking for a great music box for a long time and overwhelmed the positive reviews, I also ordered the Otter. When this came on, we had to find out that the supplied batteries were empty. If you don't have any in the house then you can't even test it... That was the first minus point. The second and then I have to connect to the negative reviews that the engine is simply too loud when lifting the belly and lowering it. It's also a disturbing noise. Also the ""white noise"", which is supposed to represent the bloodstream in the womb, sounds rather like a radio station that has no reception. For me personally it doesn't seem calming and my child does not have a calmer effect, rather the opposite was the result. The other sounds, such as heart tones and CTG, are not bad, but for us not useful, as we had to find out. The third minus point goes to the sound/leiser controller. Of course, if it's about minutes, but I think that it's even quieter. My opinion is not too cute, but it's also nice to say it's quiet in the big room."
102,1,de,Verified,Germany,12/10/2019,7,"Already the 2nd attempt - unfortunately both otters have a wobble contact or somewhere the electronics spins. If you move the otter it just goes out or he just stops the work without any action before the actual 30 minutes. So for our Lütte a pure fall, although the idea is great. Too bad."
105,5,de,Verified,Germany,11/10/2020,1,"... I'm thrilled!!! Due to our upcoming second offspring we have long thought and researched what we could buy to make our baby sleep. The little animal arrived quickly, as usual from Amazon. Unpacked and tested... The various functions are absolutely sufficient to bring a small child AND an adult to sleep. The function that the belly moves and light breath sounds are generated is absolutely ingenious. My wife and my daughter love the little animal and I must confess that it fully fulfils its purpose. We will have to get a second one because I fear that my wife will not give the first one any more :) There is a very clear purchase recommendation - 5 thick stars!"
106,2,de,Verified,Germany,15/05/2020,3,"I was really looking forward to the otter and was disappointed, he looks super cute but unfortunately the engine that makes the breathing so loud and annoying that I never use it, it cracks right and just seems cheap. Also bothers me that the operation lies inside and can only be opened with Velcro, this is then briefly also very loud and disturbs my baby."
108,5,de,Verified,Germany,25/09/2020,1,"I was skeptical at first, but then he was recommended to me so often that I let myself be carried away. ;) What should I say - NEVER WITHOUT! :) Although my baby only comes in a few weeks, nevertheless I already use the otter a lot and like it. The melodies are super pleasant and soothing and I put this otter to the heart of every growing mom, who from time to time is also restless or loses herself too often in her thoughts! ;) The heartbeat and the breathing I have muted, that was a bit suspicious to me. The light, on the other hand, is extremely beautiful and gets brighter and darker again and again. I love it! :)"
111,5,de,Verified,Germany,14/05/2020,1,"We bought the slumber otter for our 7 month old daughter. After the introduction of the evening breis she is no longer breast-fed. This made it more difficult for her to fall asleep and I often had to carry her around until she fell asleep. The otter visibly helps her to relax. She smiles at him and croaks him. She does not fall asleep faster but much more gently by means of it.We have convinced the product quality, the sound is clear and the volume control is great. It is very easy to operate. He then plays 30 minutes of music or sounds. The pulsating light and the breathing movements turn off automatically already after 15 minutes. The motor for the breathing movement is heard already, but it looks very sweet. For me, this is more like a gimmick at the older children. But the music/roofs and the gentle light are really very soothing."
112,5,de,Verified,Germany,24/10/2019,3,"I learned about the slumber otter through placed advertisements on the Internet. Seen and immediately in love, one can say at this point. Due to the good reviews here (and of course also the infatuation!), we decided to order the slumber otter. What should I say - from the infatuation has become love. Such a wonderful and high-quality product, which can do so much and seems absolutely relaxing even on adults. This cuddly toy is really worth its price. Even if my daughter will not be born until December, I already know that she will love her otter "
114,3,de,Verified,Germany,31/10/2019,1,"But the functionality of the built-in electronics, especially at this price, is not satisfactory. pros +Fabric animal in itself well processed, soft and optically appealing for children +nightlight function => Good +heartbeat function => i.e. cons songs cannot be selected (fixed loop) mechanism, which simulates the ""breathing"" of the stuffed animal, VIEL too loud. (at low volume, the music will simply overwhelm) -music playback quality is not satisfactory. (is accompanied by a very high unpleasant whistle tone) Since we wanted to use this stuffed animal mainly as a music clock, this is unfortunately unusable for us. I can't agree with the many positive reviews. The Otter (the idea is still good) goes back."
117,5,de,Verified,Germany,24/10/2019,2,"Very sweet otter with lots of beautiful songs to fall asleep! The songs are played beautifully slowly and calmingly, not in the fast pace of other musical clocks! In addition, the other sounds such as snoring,heart noise, vessel noise (like the CTG) and the light function! In addition, very sweet as the belly rises and lowers when ""breathing"". All functions can be displayed separately as it pleases the child (or adult). Also nice that the volume can be adjusted and the otter (without inner) can be washed. Absolutely you don't have to have it, but my little one and I are happy about it every day! He doesn't fall asleep yet, but the music calms him nice and if he isn't tired he is happy about the light, the music and the breathing movement. Clear purchase recommendation for all those still looking for a smart music watch or a nice gift for a baby!"
119,5,de,Verified,Germany,18/11/2019,1,"We could have used this otter much earlier. It is the best sleep aid for our daughter (7 months old) so far and not to think away. The music plays for a long time and has a pleasant tempo (not like most playing clocks) so that the mouse has enough time to fall asleep. We also like to use the breathing noise especially at night when it gets a bit restless. The otter can be restarted by a slight pressure on the belly. The engine noise (only when breathing movement) which is often mentioned here, I also feel rather calm monotonous. Unfortunately, the engine for the breathing movement after only 1 month failed because the batteries were not strong enough. We have now inserted ""ordinary"" batteries and everything works again. Thumbs high, absolute purchase recommendation! Only the price could be a little cheaper."
121,5,de,Verified,Germany,1/11/2019,1,"I tried playing clocks and two other sleeping aids for my baby before and was never convinced that they would simply stop too fast or are too loud or bad in sound. I'm excited about the otter. The volume can be adjusted, the music plays thirty minutes and the light pulsates pleasantly. In addition, the otter is designed with attention to detail.My little one fell asleep during the first attempt.If it takes longer times, you just have to press on the stomach and the last setting is repeated.One criticism point: the light goes out after 10 minutes, which irritates him if he doesn't sleep yet."
122,5,de,Verified,Germany,30/01/2020,,"We love this sweet otter. My little one sleeps very badly and finds it hard to get into deep sleep. The otter does not help to fall asleep, but sleeps again. When she falls asleep in the stroller, we turn on it when we are at home and she sleeps much more quietly and does not wake up immediately. I find it particularly great that you can adjust the volume. It is intuitive and easy to operate and all functions can be operated individually. Mostly we only have the sweet snoring on, sometimes quiet music to calm down. If she has it in her arm already breathing, but here actually disturbs the noise of the engine. The advantage to the music clock is that the otter is much quieter and plays for half an hour. Ging also with the mobile phone, but first of all, I need my mobile phone myself. We are very happy."
123,4,de,Verified,Germany,29/12/2019,2,"They're really at peace with the otters. He makes my son (5 months) sleep quickly. It's a pity that you have to use a lot of strength to push the heart down on your stomach (then cracks very loudly) so that he runs for 30 minutes. Were to send it back, but unfortunately there's only the money back instead of a new otter. I know that if something is broken, then you can exchange it. Soon something like that will only be bought in the store."
124,3,de,Verified,Germany,15/01/2021,,"The otter is really very nice and the melodies or sounds also great chosen and implemented. I also find the imitation of breathing and the little light great. Besides, the outer part can be washed well. Unfortunately, it did not work at all in our case. We have already had it for a few months and it uses nothing up to now. On the contrary, if our baby hears it / looks it wants to play with it and becomes even more awake it misses because purpose completely - we would have been incredibly happy for a sleep aid. Moreover, the electronic unit in the belly is still very hard through the fabric - if the otter is swirled around and hits the head, that is not exactly pleasant (yes, really so happened). Otherwise it is really very beautiful - he is now just a very expensive, hard cuddly animal with special effects."
126,5,de,Verified,Germany,7/12/2020,,"Our otter arrived today, much faster than indicated, :) It is totally cute, super fluffy and makes a good impression qualitatively. The melodies and sounds are very clear and not ""bleachy"" or scratchy. Really pleasant to listen to. The engine for breathing is as I don't find at all too loud as it is described in some reviews. You hear it very easily, but I don't feel it annoying. What I also think is great is that you can adjust the otter individually, tunes or sounds, breathing on or off, light on or off, several volumes, there are quite a lot of possibilities and I think there is something for every baby. For me there is a single minus point, for my taste the otter should like to be a little louder, for which one should use the quietest level it does not entirely open to me because then you can hardly hear anything. But that is also just a small downside. I would recommend the otter to everyone whose baby needs some help to fall asleep. Is surely also a very great gift for birth since it can be used from day on :)"
128,3,de,Verified,Germany,3/1/2021,,"I bought the slumber otter for my son at Christmas. Looks cute, unfortunately you can only turn on the different functions if you open the back with Velcro closure, which is quite loud. Also the loud can only be set like this. Too bad, because actually I like the functions and my son also likes to listen to the music to fall asleep. Would only like to change the noise or the volume, but this is not possible without opening the otter. Only on and off goes without opening. The great function, that the belly lowers and lifts as when breathing, is unfortunately also so loud that you can not use it to fall asleep... actually great idea but somehow not well implemented, especially for the very high price..."
129,3,de,Verified,Germany,17/08/2020,1,"Sweet guy, but he doesn't help to fall asleep, the noise level of the engine is unfortunately Made in China...Our son has been having sleep problems for weeks, because you are close to despair, you just try everything that the marketing of the baby industry gives, of course without success, noises and songs are quite nice, but is the technology in there very big and heavy, our 6 month old child, I don't want to put that in parlor cars..."
132,5,de,Verified,Germany,7/4/2020,1,"When our son was only a few weeks old, the otter didn't do anything.Now our son is almost 6 months old and the otter is our rescue! He likes him totally, calms down quickly when you turn on the otter and then even falls asleep.So it should be, it is a relief for him and for us when he has a quenching phase and is too restless to sleep.The sounds and the music don't bother me personally, I can also fall asleep. All in all, the otter would buy again."
133,5,de,Verified,Germany,4/12/2019,,"My son loves his ""sleep otti"". The melodies and sounds are very nice and soothing. Especially Otti's snoring sounds are very cute. The light has a beautiful and attractive luminosity, the breathing movements also have a special attraction. To make any new settings, you have to open a Velcro fastener on Otti's back each time and press various buttons, which are however well represented. However, it is very positive that you can simply press Otti's belly if you want to start it again with the same settings. The engine noises for the breathing movements are indeed quite loud and clear to hear, but it doesn't bother us either. Compared to similar products, I find the price for this completely in order. Schlammer otti looks super cute and certainly makes itself a great gift."
134,3,de,Verified,Germany,2/3/2021,,"Since our son (3 months) always struggles very much with the evening sleep, I ordered the slumber otter! The service is easy, the music is not intrusive and can be exhibited at any time and the cover of the otter is washable. So actually the perfect sleep-help - I thought! Unfortunately our little one found the otter obviously very frightening, because always when I tried to put it carefully beside him, he started to cry. :-(Short and short: To give away certainly very nice, but one also runs the risk that the children do not accept it and as with us, exactly the opposite occurs. Too bad, I as a mom found the otter great! :-)"
135,5,de,Verified,Germany,9/1/2020,2,"The slumber otter is a really great product. Music box and cuddly toy in one. It is in use with us daily and so far we have no problems with it. The motor to lift and lower the belly is of course heard when it runs, but it is definitely not too loud. Also the sleeping melodies are very nice. Also as a gift really recommended."
136,1,de,Verified,Germany,19/01/2020,4,"Shipping as well as well top, BUT was very disappointed when I tried the alone in demo mode only 10sec. Music with rushing, hacking the movement of the belly and the loud mechanic sounds that rob a nerves rather than relax and calm down with a long buzzing at the end went backNo recommendation to buy"
137,2,de,Verified,Germany,30/10/2019,3,"My daughter is 8 months old and likes to cuddle at night at her otter. Yes, I also think that the engine is quite ""loud"", but that calms my baby even further. Super sound selection and very nice work. 11. November The electronics is unfortunately defective. The belly lifts only briefly and then seems to clamp. Very bad!"
139,5,de,Verified,Germany,25/09/2020,,"I can only recommend it used for 1 minute and our twin sons have slept directly! The otter is so sweet I am in love directly! Could be used directly without switching on or using battery... In the otter the volume can be regulated, music plays, belly lifts and lowers, a small nightlight turn on in the form of a heart and it can play four more sounds ->heartbeat->atem->white noise-> and a sound that is known to every mommy similar to a ctg during pregnancy.. yes our boys have slept within a minute... The only thing that might be improved in the up and down movement of the belly is the meshanick to listen relatively loud..."
140,2,de,Verified,Germany,13/10/2020,,"I gave the otter to my nephew for birth. After 2 weeks the otter was broken. So a new one ordered and surprised, broken again after 2 months. It is a mystery to me how this can happen, because it lies only next to a 3 month old baby, plays music every once in a while and simulates breathing movements. The mechanics of the breathing simulation is also what constantly breaks. From Kulanz Amazon returns the money, for 2 stars. I resist to order the otter a third time but at the express request of the father, since the little one likes the otter, there is a third attempt."
141,5,de,Verified,Germany,24/01/2021,1,"A well thought-out Fischer Price product. Can be used from birth and certainly already soothing to put it still pregnant mom on the belly. Very pleasant, soothing music and the movements of the little otter lead even small explorers gently into the land of dreams. The light and music unit can be removed without any problems and then you can wash the otter in the washing machine."
143,5,de,Verified,Germany,22/10/2020,,"The melodies in this model are really tender and calming, not a glaring flicker as with other musical clocks, which even partially woke up the child. If you set the breath movement to go along, the mechanics are a bit noisy, it crunches and buzzes a little. But fortunately, that is separately adjustable.Even if you want to change the volume of the melody you have to open the Velcro closure on the back of the otter, which is of course very loud. However, I find it very practical that you can remove the technique and wash the plush animal!The light in the belly of the otter always becomes a bit brighter and darker, not flickering way but with completely liquid transitions. This looks great and soothes my little daughter (3 months) even at night, so she looks at the light very calmly and fascinated. I recommend this article to all becoming parents, also as a gift definitely a good choice, so that you do something good for her child."
144,4,de,Verified,Germany,17/10/2020,1,"The otter, which got the name Otto from our son, is beautiful. It is very fluffy, the music is very nice and practical, that you can adjust everything individually and adjust the music volume. The only stupid is the volume of the engine while breathing. That's louder than the music, which is why we always turn it off. But even without this function, the cuddly toy is recommended."
145,5,de,Verified,Germany,9/10/2020,,"This little otter should be for my 20-week-old son. Well wrong thought, the 2.5-year-old has stifled himself at once and for a long time not left out of his hands. So as you can see. It is for every age class. As soon as I come into the living room the beautiful melody sounds. Which is very pleasant, because it is very gentle and quiet. I find the details of the little otter very golden. It was washed even without problems and quickly again attached to the sound box. I am completely satisfied and would always recommend it."
148,5,de,Verified,Germany,24/04/2020,1,Super cute and the heartbeat function has a very soothing effect on my child. My midwife was somewhat skeptical about the function of imitation of the maternal heartbeat with regard to breathing. She was concerned that just newborns could stop breathing by the memory of the time in the womb? So far we have not been able to observe this.
149,4,de,Verified,Germany,26/01/2020,,"The otter is really very cute, original as seen on the picture. Very cuddly, soft fur that is a little fussy. The melody is very nice, the volume can be controlled loud and quiet. The heart palpitation noise also comes over very well and shows its effect, both with the children and with the mother =)The function of the breathing otter is a nice idea, but the meschanic sounds are very disturbing when moving the belly. The module can be easily removed and inserted back by means of a Velcro closure."
150,2,de,Verified,Germany,25/01/2021,,"Unfortunately, I didn't see that you have to pay the return shipment yourself, the package had exactly the size that it can only be sent expensively...We disturbed the following: the breathing movements we find rather creepy and totally unnatural. Can't imagine that a child (no infant, our child is already 18 months old) does not find that strange.The volume at the lowest level was still too loud for us. If you imagine listening to the music in a totally quiet, dark room, I would find the music too present and no background music.Unfortunately, you can't take the animal out and look at it rationally, then you would irrevocably destroy the packaging."
151,3,de,Verified,Germany,10/11/2020,,"The otter is super sweet and cuddly soft. Also the volume control is great, it can be set to sleep with (-) very quiet. The slumber light is quite dark, but sufficient. It's better to change a bit too dark than too bright. You can switch between music and natural sounds or even use only the slumber light! That's really great! The pressing of the belly around the last setting to activate again is easy, also for the baby. The sense of the roaring belly that moves does not open up to me, but many babies like that. We would also like to keep it very much, but the electronic unit is apparently too big with motor etc., so that the otter is too heavy to be kept by a baby. We would simply be afraid that the otter falls on the face if our little one gets taken up somehow. Really a pity, because the otter really unites everything we have looked for as a sleep aid (silence, separate light, beautiful song selection, automatic switch off)."
152,4,de,Verified,Germany,1/1/2021,,"Sweet otter, which is still nice and cuddly even after washing. The functions are varied and can be adjusted accordingly. The light is a great night light - not too bright. The melody can be regulated in the volume and thus also great to fall asleep. However, I personally find the breathing simulation quite loud and the ""motor"" which lifts the otter breast and lowers very prominently. But you can also simply switch off. With the control unit the otter is quite heavy - without but perfect for babies."
153,3,de,Verified,Germany,13/12/2019,,"Unfortunately, the otter doesn't work right from the start. We slurped it in and after 2 minutes at the latest it is out without any touch. The lifting and senk movement when it works short is extremely loud can't imagine that it should be that way.Unfortunately I'm very disappointed because we were so happy to have found something for our little one at last and then it just doesn't work right.In itself it would be a super great gift or a great companion for the little ones in the evening but just for that it would have to work"
156,4,de,Verified,Germany,15/10/2020,,"The Otter is a very nice sleeping aid. The music is very pleasant, for my feeling much more relaxing than with similar articles. The following things are striking: - The buttons for switching on are behind a Velcro fastener. When you open this one is very loud. Very sad that there is no other solution here (zip, remote control). - The music runs only 30 minutes, which I feel as something short. If you want to turn on the music again, it is very loud as described above. Here would be a timer of advantage, which you can set yourself. - The motor for the abdominal movements is a bit loud. With sensitive children this can certainly also be very annoying. If you don't mind these aspects, you will find a great sleeping aid for your child here!"
157,5,de,Verified,Germany,17/02/2021,,"We took him out of the box and closed him right into our heart! Everything went very quickly. As usual Amazon delivered quickly, we packed the little otter, quickly put the batteries in and off it went :-) My daughter ( 1 1/2 years) closed him right into the heart - and my wife and I too! Now the little one, called ""Otter"" by all of us, is simply a part of the family! Sounds, music and the glow of his heart can be controlled well by an integrated control unit, This is well integrated into the otter, so that the little one can't take you out so quickly. The batteries keep with us for several months during daily use. The otter is washable according to the instructions and is very soft and pleasant. We feel the music is beautiful and soothing. If, my daughter and I, want to make a midday sleep, our otter is always with us. Our daughter loves him and we don't give him any more. That's my opinion of one of the best inventions for which we can not fall asleep well, want to relax and make a beautiful baby's sleep for all our children and make it a lovely baby's sleep."
159,5,de,Verified,Germany,6/11/2020,,"The first impression is that the little face looks a bit cheaper than expected. But the breathing function and the light are really nice and you don't find anywhere else. The motor for the movement is a bit loud but due to its monotony will have a similar calming effect as the rest of the sounds. The music/noise are all pleasant and the operation easy. Conclusion: for home sweet, I wouldn't give it away rather because it doesn't look very good"
160,5,de,Verified,Germany,22/05/2020,1,"Very nice music box. It looks like on the picture. I don't know if the batteries were there anymore. I find it very sweet, also from the volume I find it good. Even my son who was at the time 3 years old thought it was great and wanted to have one too. I can recommend this otter very much because it is exactly as described."
161,5,de,Verified,Germany,14/11/2020,,"A great gadget even in pregnancy. I like to put the otters on my stomach and the small belly dweller reacts to the melody. He has some melodies and also a noise or sweet snoring on offer. I find handling a bit more difficult, because you have to open your back to change volume or mode. Nevertheless a nice companion and I am happy when our baby is in the world. Fast shipping, get on primeday cheaper."
163,5,de,Verified,Germany,10/1/2020,,"I was only skeptical, because my daughter only fell asleep for 12 months while still and cuddly animals hardly pays attention. Thought also that the light could rather disturb than help when falling asleep. Well, I was taught a better one! At Christmas I gave it away, we had nothing to lose and now it has become a ritual to turn on the otter in the evening and the light is pleasantly soft, warm and becomes in the rhythm of the breath brighter and darker. The breathing noise hears it most. Simply hammer!!! ***** Selection of melodies is top, volume control top quality top and batteries were also present. The only thing you CAN complain about: For example, if you want to switch from the breathing noise to music you have to do this manually, i.e. the Velcro closure at the back (sticks bomb-proof, because good quality) and then open and close again. However, it is still great, because you can wash the otter also after the inner life has been removed. But if you listen to the same thing as we do every evening, you simply press the belly and the otter is on or turn off again ;"
164,3,de,Verified,Germany,22/04/2020,,"Very cute look and works well but I would have liked to have a little more cuddly character. Due to the noise module, the otter is quite heavy, even for adults...my daughter therefore always needs help if she wants to wear it. In addition, I find it a bit worrying especially with small children that the noise module is very easy to access (only by Velcro ""protected"")...would have wanted me more child safety"
165,5,de,Verified,Germany,6/10/2020,,"The slumber otter was bought as a gift for a baby party. The parents were very happy about this unique gift. We are also glad that we did not decide for one of the many Pinterest ideas (windling places etc.), because this was too high. We have still decorated the otter with sweets and a congratulations card for quiet evenings/nights. For all those who also need a gift they should access here."
167,2,de,Verified,Germany,11/2/2021,1,"The slumber otter is actually a nice product. The sounds as well as the ""breathing"" of the animal are soothing and the music is wonderful. I was really excited about the otter that I bought as a gift for a newborn. Unfortunately, after barely two weeks of use, he already had a defect, because the music and the breathing movement did not work properly anymore. Amazon quickly made a remedy and so I was able to exchange the product for the friends I had given it to. Unfortunately, the second product after not even two months of use also shows the error, which is very sad and leads to the fact that I will not give the otter any more. :/"
168,5,de,Verified,Germany,25/07/2020,,"So our little one calms down very well with Otti, at first she didn't fall asleep but was distracted almost the whole time or inspected him more closely. Meanwhile she also falls asleep with him and keeps her hand on the moving belly between time and time again.Can Otti only recommend :)Of course the motor is a bit clunky but doesn't really bother. The engine is running very quietly so far despite frequent use. All in one was a good investment"
169,5,de,Verified,Germany,20/01/2021,,"Our 2 month old son loves the otter. He plays different melodies, snorting and breathing sounds, heartbeat as well as white noise. In addition, the belly cover moves and shines - which can be switched off or switched on. Especially the white noise is very popular here in case of restlessness or to fall asleep.The volume can be regulated wonderfully and is absolutely sufficient. The electronics can be easily removed to clean the otter. Besides, the otter is also really cute to look at. We would definitely buy it again."
170,1,de,Verified,Germany,8/2/2020,1,"Actually a nice idea, the functions are very nice and reassuring. Our daughter 15 months found him great.Now the big hook comes: he does not work any more after a short time, always goes off on his own and can then no longer be switched on.He was returned and ordered elsewhere, but also the second one there was the same problem. Also this was returned and we don't want any more. Battery change (supplied batteries are probably only intended for demo purposes in the shop) helped nothing at all."
171,5,de,Verified,Germany,31/01/2021,,"Like myself, the otter was given for our still unborn daughter, but I always put it on her stomach and play the music before her, that's great about it that I can regulate the volume and the whole thing is finished after 30 minutes by itself.To this there are several functions of noises etc., which certainly have a very relaxing effect for a baby.I am very excited about him and he seems very reassuring.My niece (3) was so excited about this when visiting that the aunt did not miss it, to fulfill her desire for her own otter at Christmas and this is no longer to think away from her. She only sleeps with him!"
173,4,de,Verified,Germany,5/1/2021,,"I find it a bit hard to cuddle through the engine in the abdomen. But the fur and the head are very soft and cuddly. I find the engine quite loud. What makes our little ones scare up is the Velcro clasp on the back of the otter. This one must always open to press the buttons, quite loud. A small zipper or push buttons would be better here.Everything in all, however, the otter is cute, plays sleepy songs, mimics heartbeat, breathing and noise."
174,5,de,Verified,Germany,31/10/2020,,"Super sweet sleeping aid for babies, pleasant melody and the light and the sound of the heartbeat is very soothing. Much better than a music box. Especially since it goes out on its own after about 30 minutes. Perfect!After half a year there were problems and the otters didn't work anymore. Got free replacement, so everything perfect! Didn't even have to send it back. Nice seller. Would I buy again and again."
175,5,de,Verified,Germany,6/1/2021,,The slumber otter was from Grandma and Grandpa a Christmas gift to our sonloudness is absolutely ok for babies to fall asleep and also the different modis leave no wish open and keep the offspring in moodThe size of the otter is also absolutely sufficient for a baby and also really cuddly is the otter.Definitely recommended as the first sleep cuddly help :)
176,3,de,Verified,Germany,14/11/2019,1,"Basically a good product only unfortunately not thought to end. The otter lies with in the bed and seduces to cuddle only unfortunately the otter together with the inside lying operating unit is very hard and heavy and when breathing it crawls. Furthermore, this super nice shell on the belly so interesting to press around that is played rather instead of sleeping. In addition, everyone who has a relative skillful child notices that it also has the Velcro closure open within a very short time and presses around on the control unit."
177,5,de,Verified,Germany,5/11/2020,,"To the Otter: Super sweet cuddly toy, the belly is the on/off switch, individually you can also adjust volume, music, heart tone, abdominal movement and light at the back of the device. The device can be taken from the otter, so it can also be washed. For me a very clear purchase recommendation, certainly also arrives very well as a gift for freshly baked parents! I would have been very happy about it."
179,5,de,Verified,Germany,1/12/2019,,"The plush animal in itself is very nice and well processed, cuddly and neutral in the smell. The technique consists of a block of hard plastic in which everything is installed. Personally, I find that the device is not soft enough embedded in the stuffed animal. So you notice the hard one very clearly. But my wife finds it great, especially to bring our 6 weeks young daughter to sleep."
180,4,de,Verified,Germany,19/10/2020,,The small slumber otter is really sweet.. It is very quiet about the noise setting (the motor for the belly movement) and the music can also be controlled well in the volume.. The shell on the belly is also provided with light which can also be switched off... I am very happy also with the processing... Very soft fabric.. It could be slightly more fed but with some fabric in addition inside it is also solved.. The ECU inside is a little big but very easy made understand.. Very soft keystroke no clapping.. Would I recommend it because it simulates also heart tone and blood flow sounds like in the womb which certainly seems very soothing... So then make yourself a picture of it.. 9 out of 10 points which someone needs a classification... 
181,5,de,Verified,Germany,12/2/2021,,"We are super satisfied with the otter. Not only does it look cute, but the noises also come very well with my little one. The light is not too bright and the breath movement is even, even though it is not very natural. However, we only use the sounds because my little one doesn't care about the other functions. Nevertheless, I find that the otter has earned five stars. The volume can be easily adjusted that it is not too loud. If you are looking for a nice gift no matter whether girl or young, I am sure that it always comes well."
182,2,de,Verified,Germany,1/2/2021,1,"In itself I find the otter great, unfortunately we had already for the second time a model, which after a few weeks is defective. The button on the belly for automatic on and off was both times suddenly defective and does not work anymore. The different sounds, songs, the light and also the optics are very nice and soothing and our daughter has become so accustomed to falling asleep with the little (and I also ) that we will now probably or badly order one for the third time and hope that this will last longer this time!!!"
183,4,de,Verified,Germany,9/11/2020,,"Very cuddly and important noise options available.Moving the visit combined with the light is already very reassuring.In addition, breathe in and out as a noise option.Unfortunately only find the engine a little too loud, but that's my perception, my little one doesn't realize it anyway and he likes it. As a gift for newborns I find it more than suitable!"
184,5,de,Verified,Germany,16/01/2021,,"This otter convinced even my very sceptical husband immediately! He helped my daughter straight away. The otter was a very strong recommendation from my friend, who uses it with her son and he immediately falls asleep. But it not only helps my baby to fall asleep but even calms me down. It is always 30 minutes. First the abdominal movement goes out after 10 minutes and then after another 10 minutes the pleasant light, followed after another 10 minutes of the set noise.Real class!!! We would buy it again and again and give it to fresh parents!!!"
185,5,de,Verified,Germany,18/08/2020,1,"Super invention, my son ( 3 months old) sleeps much faster and better and the otter is also taken to cuddle. Can I really recommend if the child has problems with falling asleep. Does so even with my daughter(4 years) which sometimes has real difficulties falling asleep. So is also something for older children. Conclusion I would buy it again every time and is also a great gift for freshly baked parents. Also suitable for fruits because there is the function where you can only turn on the heartbeat is then almost like in Mama's belly."
186,5,de,Verified,Germany,28/12/2020,1,"I was skeptical at first, but the otter is now part of our sleep routine.We exhibited the breathing but the rest is just great!The somewhat clumsy body doesn't bother us, since the otter (until now) does not serve as a cuddle."
187,1,de,Verified,Germany,22/10/2020,,"The otter is at first glance very sweet, BUT the electronic part is totally thick and noticeable, so that the otter is hardly suitable for cuddles. Besides, after 6 weeks the electronics broke directly with us, nothing could be played off! A cheekyness for such a nameable manufacturer, because this happened not only with this otter, but even with the reordering!!"
188,4,de,Verified,Germany,12/1/2021,,Our twins Dear Emmet (as we have baptized him) The only thing I have to complain about is that you can't hire him to play longer. After 30 minutes the music is off. I would have wished that you could decide for yourself because if the babies are restless I would need 1h or 1 1/2h. So I have to get up and go on again. Otherwise ingenious the part
189,4,de,Verified,Germany,23/06/2020,,"The otter is incredibly cute and invites you to cuddle. You can switch between different melodies, snoring, heartbeat and rasping, you can adjust that it makes breathing movements and that its belly glows. A star trigger is there for you to see nowhere, which songs these are and the engine that represents the breathing is relatively loud. Otherwise great"
191,5,de,Verified,Germany,15/02/2021,,"Not only does this slumber otter look very neat, it also has great settings to support the baby's sleep.With its various settings you can let yourself be soaked by the soft sounds, follow the heartbeat and breath sounds or just turn on a small light when baby is afraid in the dark.He is firmly anchored in bed and is one of our evening and sleep rituals."
193,5,de,Verified,Germany,16/09/2020,,"I bought this sleeping aid from Fisher Price, because we also have the old version in the form of a penguin (now 8 years old and still works).This otter is really sweet. He has a very good choice of music. My son (3 years old) doesn't want to fall asleep without him anymore. Even the movements of the belly are quiet and with the turn on of the light children no longer have any fear in the dark.A second otter was already worried for my niece, because the enthusiasm of the parents is also great."
196,5,de,Verified,Germany,13/12/2020,,"My niece (1 year) loves the slumber otter. He goes to bed with her and sometimes she also plays with him alone. She can turn him on and off herself. I gave him to her because she often got very quenchy at lunchtime. With ""Otti"" this works better now. You can adjust different melodies and sounds. His belly lifts and lowers. I give him more often because he is not only sweet, but really helps to fall asleep and so relieves everyone a little bit and he always gets very good."
197,4,de,Verified,Germany,1/10/2020,,"Great and so realistic with heartbeat, music, breathing and light! Volume can be regulated and by pressing on the belly can deactivate the set function as well as activate again - this is great! You just have to love it! Unfortunately the breathing function cracks already after a short time, which can be very disturbing when falling asleep! Also it imposes itself more often! But otherwise a real lovable and great stuffed animal!"
198,5,de,Verified,Germany,23/01/2021,,"Our son is already 1 year old and just as long we use the Otti already during the evening ritual to fall asleep. We like above all the pleasant music, not too intrusive, not too loud or shrill. Simply relaxing to fall asleep. We only use the light for some time, which is also very nice. Not too bright, very warm light which alternately becomes brighter and darker again. All in all a great music box."
200,4,de,Verified,Germany,14/01/2021,,"I am very satisfied with the slumber otter. You can adjust the volume of the music individually & I like the choice of the sleeping songs that it plays. I also like that you can also switch off the abdominal movement. The only drawback is that it is relatively hard. You could have taken better care of the price, that the otter is better padded out. Because you can feel the engine very clearly. That's why there is also the one point deduction."
202,5,de,Verified,Germany,23/11/2020,,Would the part buy again and again and find it very well suited as a gift. It plays several melodies and simulates breathing and heart sounds. My little one also often presses the part in sleep and does not want to miss it anymore. The heart also gives off some light so that when she wakes up it is not pitch dark in the room.
204,5,de,Verified,Germany,5/3/2021,1,"I can't believe it. Since Paul, the Otter moved in, Mausilein can fall asleep and sleep alone.She was not a ""delete"" child and needed mom or dad to sleep. Either on his arm or next to both. It works completely without us and even the pacifier spits it out before.First of all, ours is so demanding that the otter is meaningless, wrongly thought.I can recommend the otter to anyone."
205,2,de,Verified,Germany,30/01/2020,1,Would be a nice sleeping toy if the engine of the belly breathing wasn't constantly defective. I now sent the second one back with defective.Otherwise music and light very nice. But for the price I expect a baby toy to last longer than 2 months. Therefore I can't recommend it.
206,5,de,Verified,Germany,9/2/2021,,"Great gift for future parents. I have already ordered several times for young children with friends and family and was always one of the best gifts and investments.The noise level is fine. The smooth movement of the belly calms the baby and the otter conveys a situation similar to that in the mother's belly. It serves as a sleep aid for babies and calms it at the same time.One of my favorites presents, on the one hand it makes a lot of visuals and on the other hand the functionality is also exciting and highly recommended!"
207,5,de,Verified,Germany,13/02/2021,,"Hello and good evening, We have the Otter now about 2 weeks and I have to say I'm thrilled. The volume is adjustable, it makes music, heart tones and much more. Due to the adjustable volume you can control the noise level. This disturbed me to the normal mobiles arg, because the meanwhile are so loud that you can hardly talk normally. I can not think it away at all. Our small mouse (3 months) sleeps every evening with it and is totally relaxed. The best thing is that you can remove the electrical part from the middle and thus wash the Otter super. Therefore, at any time a recommendation value and I would give it away also every time. I hope I could help with this review. Have fun with the little friend "
208,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/12/2019,,"The little otter is magical! It imitates sounds from the womb, such as the mother's heartbeat or the noise, like in the amniotic fluid. It also makes breathing sounds and the music is very pleasant and soothing. You can also adjust the volume! A sweet gift!"
209,3,de,Verified,Germany,19/07/2020,,"We bought it as a gift. Visually it is a highlight...very sweet and well processed.The breathing movement and the light on the belly are also great.For me, the sound effects (heartbeat and mother's womb sounds) are too artificial and irritating...The music is also not that what you know about musical clocks but rather psychedelic."
210,3,de,Verified,Germany,1/3/2021,,"We bought the otter around the Black Friday. Our daughter then got it at Christmas and a month later it was unfortunately defective. We got a new one very quickly however. (For 5 stars) However, in my opinion you have to change the batteries very often, which is why we switched off the breath and the air function. Thus the battery lasts longer.Our daughter likes the otter, however, I find the constant price fluctuations between 35 and 45€ quite questionable... for 45€ I would definitely not have bought the otter."
211,5,de,Verified,Germany,13/10/2020,,"A very nice mobile. She takes this better than the baby phone-like mobile. The music is nice relaxing and sounds great. We haven't tried everything else that way yet. The plush is probably what she likes. I like the extra light, also that it goes out before the music goes out. It was worth the price."
212,5,de,Verified,Germany,8/12/2020,,The otter itself is worth its money. Our little one loves it from the first day on. The melodies are soothing and the volume can be adjusted perfectly. Slowly our little one's eyes fall too while he listens and looks dreamy on the small night light on the belly.But also with adults... ;)
214,5,de,Verified,Germany,26/11/2020,,"But tonight, as if he had guessed what to get for Christmas, there was no way to go to sleep. So the Christmas present was preferred and the otter unpacked. I thought it was very good that it could go off right away and not first had to be filled with batteries. Every mom / dad knows it - the baby screams it has to go quickly. The otter arrived at the otter, the little one accepted it very well, of course he found the light very great. It didn't take two minutes and he slept. And small tip on the edge: With dad it also works great! "
215,5,de,Verified,Germany,12/1/2020,,"Our ""Ottie"" is very popular. It is already taken here over all she wants to sleep with. My mouse sleeps since the quieter. And I can push her away after the good night silently without crying she sleeps with her ""Ottie"" nice on. With us the Ottie ""sniffs"" the function is great because my husband and also I are snoring or breathing in the sleep sound. So I can get up again in the evening. He is very fluffy. Alas, if he could be even more upholstered. Since the ""machine"" is still quite hard when you get it to the head. XD.That the belly moves still as if it really breathes is very soothing. Cheap batteries keep up with full function 2 nights. I find that is a very high power consumption."
216,5,de,Verified,Germany,7/9/2020,,"The slumber otter was a gift for my 9 month young nephew :-)It is totally soothing, comes to rest and can fall asleep better through the gentle melodies, even the bigger sister, who also comes to rest faster :-)The otter has already become a sleeping ritual for the two :-)"
219,5,de,Verified,Germany,15/01/2021,,"We have been looking for a suitable music box for a very long time. With my son we had such a sleep bear with heart and noise sounds 9 years ago, this was really terrible...he was terribly loud and the sounds were more indefinable, cracked,.After a long search and reading through all the recessions we decided for this one and we are all super enthusiastic :) my son (9 years) also finds it great. The melodies are beautiful and the heart tones sound at least also to heart. The volume is adjustable, the light goes on or off and the breathing of the otter is also switchable on or off. All in all a super great, sweet cuddly animal that is definitely soon loved and needed intimately!!!"
220,5,de,Verified,Germany,8/11/2020,,"Really great part!The otter is very well processed in quality, the sounds don't sound tinkering and the operation is very easy.The melodies on it are actually very soothing and my baby sleeps very well. I can definitely recommend the otter, it also makes itself very good as a gift."
221,3,de,Verified,Germany,12/1/2021,,"The otter is totally cute!! The sound is also great. The ""motor"" is still quite loud.. I would have hoped that you could not hear it so clearly. the otter would also have been a little better ""to be filled "" since you can tap the electronics / battery. My baby is not yet in the world - yet I hope very much that the otter can calm them down or she can sleep well with him."
222,5,de,Verified,Germany,2/12/2020,,"We fell in love with this little otter already at the beginning of the pregnancy. On Black Friday the little one was ordered and arrived a short time later. The music is very pleasant, the breathing certainly calms for the child and overall makes this toy a great impression! It was also important to us that the toy is washable, if something goes wrong and that is also possible here, wonderful!"
223,4,de,Verified,Germany,1/12/2019,,"My little one (3 months) falls asleep much better. At first I was skeptical whether such a part really brings something. Our little one only falls asleep when you weigh it or wear it. If he is tired now, we put the otter next to him and he finds himself in sleep. However, there is a point trigger because the motor that makes the breathing movement is really loud and because this whole construct in the otter is really clumsy."
224,4,de,Verified,Germany,1/1/2021,,"The otter is definitely positive with our baby, the melodies are also bearable for adults and please the child, it is still relatively cuddly despite all the technical interiors.The night light is a little weak, but that was not the most important thing for us when buying.As a dad I can only criticize the processing of the Velcro fastener at the back and the screw connection of the battery compartment at first. I think that one could find a more subtle solution at the back. Despite all this, the whining is at a high level and I can make a clear purchase recommendation."
225,5,de,Verified,Germany,27/11/2020,,The greatest thing we have ever bought!My baby 6 months and I sleep so well with the beautiful music. Very relaxing and very nice slumbers!I only hope he lasts very long and doesn't break so fast.The heartbeat and the breathing movements are also good. So far the money has always been worth it.
227,4,de,Verified,Germany,17/03/2020,,"Great stuffed animal, our six-month-old son loves it, so far we did not have a defect (after about four months of use) and the otter is also good washable. There are two criticisms, however, why a star was pulled off: 1. The engine for the breathing movement is relatively loud, especially if the environment is very quiet, like for example to fall asleep and also the quietest volume of the melodies / sounds is not yet quiet enough for our taste. 2. We have meanwhile switched to rechargeable batteries, since the otter is a battery eater when used. So buy your wallet and the unworldly for your sake suitable batteries."
228,5,de,Verified,Germany,18/11/2020,,"So something of sweet and fluffy. I love him. Lamp lights up briefly and moves his belly while breathing. He purrs briefly and plays beautiful soft melodies. Couldn't test him yet because I packed him as a gift but what I saw, heard and felt is top. Would I buy again."
231,4,de,Verified,Germany,3/11/2020,,"Super sweet otter to fall asleep.In many reviews it is mentioned that the otter is not so cuddly. It is already soft and cuddly, however, you should not forget that there is an engine in the otter. This ensures after all for music and the abdominal movement and for that it is quite cuddly.We find the otter great and make it go to bed in the evening."
232,4,de,Verified,Germany,30/11/2020,,"Sweet otter for the very small ones.Unfortunately, the engine is very disturbing you can hear it extremely when the otter breathes.Otherwise, to look at it sweetly and the light is very practical at night. The melodies and sounds are pleasant. Would use it right from birth so that the children get used to it."
238,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/11/2020,,Totally sweet! We all love our Mr Otter. Super sleep help for our daughter (8 months) and cat to fall asleep we always take the melodies. Find it only very bad that the otter automatically ends after only 30 minutes. Our daughter wakes up during her midday sleep.
239,5,de,Verified,Germany,28/12/2020,,"We love him. My little one has had him since she was 2 months and we can't think him away anymore. He helps her very much to fall asleep.Little down, the engine is quite noisy when you turn on the function where the abdominal wall rises and lowers. As this is very annoying we don't use it. All other noises and settings are separately adjustable and adjustable."
240,3,de,Verified,Germany,30/10/2019,1,"The otter itself, is cute, and also cuddly. Unfortunately, I have to say that I feel the engine as quite loud, which does not contribute to falling asleep. The music, goes like this, unfortunately they are not played very long and changes quickly. Also the noises, I find sometimes rather disturbing, rather than reassuring. With us, he unfortunately did not help."
242,4,de,Verified,Germany,8/11/2020,,"I haven't really understood the hype around this otter so far.I bought the slumber animal as a gift, but tried it myself out of interest before.I felt the breathing noises were disturbing, and despite the timer, the music continued to doddle in endless loops in the early morning hours."
245,3,de,Verified,Germany,5/10/2020,,"Unfortunately, after a few days it turned out that it has unfortunately a malfunction. Writed for a refund & I should take over the shipping itself?! I should now pay for it, that I got a B- goods sent?! Very disappointing. The first few days it still worked, only unfortunately the motor movement was rather loud from the beginning and then it has already given up the mind. The music itself was beautiful & only unfortunately does not work with the movement. I am glad that I did not give it away."
247,5,de,Verified,Germany,1/12/2020,,"Otterchen has been in use since the 1st day after being released from the hospital and also several times. The battery stops and stops :) However, we only use sound and light. If our little one weng times, we do the white noise. There are no sound differences at the moment and therefore Otterchen deserves an absolute purchase recommendation. The light could possibly still tolerate a color changer, but I am enthusiastic about the sound as well as the other functions."
248,2,de,Verified,Germany,2/3/2021,,"I received this article already in December, because I expect young people in June and really looked forward to it after all the awards on Instagram and Co.. I noticed already at the first commissioning that one attitude gives an incredibly disturbing noise of itself and that the engine is still very loud during the breathing movement. In my opinion therefore not at all suitable for newborns or babies. The functions themselves are really sweet, so I ordered it again, in the hope that it was a Sunday model. Unfortunately this was not the case."
249,5,de,Verified,Germany,10/2/2021,,"Mega Sweet, very nice for big and small. The melody from the tone is really top there are so many bad music clocks but this otter just sounds great of the quality also the songs that are played are very soothing "
250,3,de,Verified,Germany,12/1/2020,,"The Otter is a nice gift with many great options. As a music box it is great.However, I can't recommend it to cuddle because the engine inside is hard and it can't be cuddled and it is very difficult for small baby hands. Nevertheless, a nice companion for the night."
252,5,de,Verified,Germany,19/11/2020,,"We have great pleasure with the otter... the heart tones sound like in the mom's belly and have a calming effect on my daughter! Super also that the volume can be adjusted individually. My daughters got the otter with 5 weeks - now it is 9 weeks and starts to look at the light and grab!We are absolutely satisfied and I am sure that with increasing age the other functions with joy will come to use! Which also totally inspires me, that you can take the music part inside out quite easily, and the otters can give so in the washing machine!Absolutely recommend further and especially useful for newborns!"
254,3,de,Verified,Germany,17/11/2020,,"My niece doesn't like it. When switched on and off, the cuddly toy sucks enormously. It looks cute and fluffy, but also hard because of the electronics. So no real cuddly toy. I wouldn't buy it again."
255,5,de,Verified,Germany,16/11/2019,,Price/Performance Top! The slumber otter has several functions that can be combined with each other. Light music (very pleasant volume) Breathe heartbeat belly rhythmically up and down move. The otter runs 30 minutes and then goes out. Highly recommended! My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves him.
256,3,de,Verified,Germany,17/07/2020,,"One of the Otters has already given up the spirit. It was for the grandchildren. There were tears that one already does not work. Since I am not on site, I can also do nothing, send back etc. - A replacement would have been very good. Now we have a sad child."
257,5,de,Verified,Germany,4/2/2020,,Just recommended and not to think away from our household anymore. Our son got the otter at just under 3 months at Christmas. Since he is plagued by colics a somewhat restless child we tried a lot to create calm. Since we have the otter it works great! He tries to crawl into it formally in it is so sweet! Only disturbing point are they perceptible engine noises while lifting and lowering the chest. The little one obviously doesn't mind! We use it exclusively during the day when the little one is under observation. At night I see the danger that he could suffocate because he is really pressing his face on the otter.
259,5,de,Verified,Germany,26/05/2020,,My little one sleeps very well with it. He looks cute is half well upholstered and that would definitely be better. He can be washed what was very important to me and after a short period of frustration when the breathing was no longer in and let it be turned off now everything works fine again.
260,2,de,Verified,Germany,7/12/2019,,"The otter is very soft and well processed. The inside is removable, so that the cuddly toy can be washed. Operation is simple and easy to use. Nevertheless, this sleep aid is only partially suitable for babies. The engine that lifts our stomach is unfortunately so loud that it completely overcomes the soothing sounds when they are set to a quiet volume. If the sounds are at maximum volume, you still hear the engine. This is quite annoying. Since we can't use this product to fall asleep with all the functions (only lift and lower the belly), we decided to return the product."
261,5,de,Verified,Germany,18/11/2020,,"My daughter is totally on the otter. However, after 2 months of intensive use he has a problem. The engine for the belly no longer works and the hum of the engine is hardly overhearable and almost overcomes the loudest attitude of the music level.When I bought this little guy at the time I paid almost 60€. I have to say honestly for the short life is to me in hindsight but I would have expected that he will last longer."
262,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/12/2019,1,"My baby loves him and is now tighter to fall asleep.I don't want to think him away anymore.I also had problems with the electronics after about 3 weeks, but it turned out that this starts, a safe sign is to replace the batteries "
263,5,de,Verified,Germany,30/01/2021,,The otter is really a great gift for the little ones among us. Due to the different tones and melodies a good sleep help. What also has to be said: in case of problems the seller is really very friendly and tries to help as soon as possible or to exchange the toy / to send again. Really top
264,5,de,Verified,Germany,25/12/2020,,"So my son is 3 months old and he likes the otter. Due to the volume control it is optimal to adjust. Different functions enrich the whole still... Like e.g. noises like from the womb, calm the light and breathing of the otter. I am thrilled. It has been very pleasant. Top gift."
266,4,de,Verified,Germany,7/6/2020,,"An optically totally sweet playmate. The varied and individually controllable functions convince me, the engine also does not feel as too loud. However, the control element is very large and also heavy for small children's hands. In addition, the cuddly otter from the back is not well lined, so that you can feel the edges of the engine strongly. For this there was a star trigger, because it takes on cuddly quality. I will add something to our otter from the back to make it softer. The necessary space is available in the music box."
267,5,de,Verified,Germany,15/11/2019,,"My children love him!! First of all I bought the otter for my 1 year old son, because it took him a long time to fall asleep and was constantly awake at night. But also my daughter (3 years) and also I can sleep great with the sounds! I use the mother's body noises, the music box and the other functions I do not use. Due to the adjustable volume you can adjust the sounds individually. My son cuddles with the otter and falls asleep in a few minutes. When he wakes up at night, I press the otter only briefly and my son falls asleep quickly again. New batteries last relatively long! (approx. 1 month) Only criticism: with older children the breath function does not work if the otter is held sideways in the arm or the arm is placed over the belly of the otter. therefore I have completely disabled the function, as the otter would otherwise constantly shut off."
270,1,de,Verified,Germany,22/01/2021,,"I received the Otter as a replacement order, because the first one on the electronic part was a bit defective. Now I get this one here, which works normally, but: the quality of the fabric is not the same! The Otter has only a ""painted"" face, while the other one was embroidered with the nose, whiskers and the mouth. Which is of course qualitatively inferior with the replacement now! I will probably have to send it in again and hope to get a reasonable replacement until the birth of my child. At the price one should expect that!"
271,5,de,Verified,Germany,27/12/2020,,"I was skeptical at first, but our little son thinks it's great. The volume can be super regulated. What spoke for me very much for the beaver was that you can take it completely apart to wash the fabric when it's dirty."
273,4,de,Verified,Germany,17/12/2020,,"Very sweet, the light is good, the music is beautiful, the ""real"" heartbeat very soothing.Beautiful would be if you could make something quieter.Simply ridiculous, on the other hand, I find the ""snoring"", there comes a comic noise à la ""chrr pijuuu""... Does not need such a person."
274,5,de,Verified,Germany,25/11/2020,,"The slumber otter is not to be thought away anymore!!! It was immediately super accepted and I find the music as well as the sounds very soothing and pleasant! Wouldn't have expected it to arrive so well with us, since we also have other musical clocks. But somehow it radiates calmness."
276,1,de,Verified,Germany,12/9/2020,1,"First delivery: Breath movements don't work. Second delivery: Engine is so loud, I don't want to do that to my child.Unfortunately, I was really looking forward to it."
278,4,de,Verified,Germany,11/8/2020,,"We and our daughter love the otter, it has many functions, is totally fluffy and the volume can be adjusted super. The only drawback and therefore also a star pull off: The engine is very loud when ""breathing"", which is why we cannot use the functionWe will buy another 2.Otter for the sibling because it arrives so well."
279,5,de,Verified,Germany,27/12/2020,,Umbeding BUY!!! Worth every cent! Make the otter always on when I lay down my little one (2/3 months) he sleeps suoer with the otter & even me he calms down ;) Volume can also be regulated! The breathing movement are also dear & the music very pleasant :) 10min always the breath with music & dan 20 minutes only music without light
281,5,de,Verified,Germany,17/12/2020,,"It works and that's all that matters. The otter was bought for the 3 month old baby for birth. But the big brother at 3.5 years has torn the otter under the nail. He sleeps deeply and firmly with it. Thus, the mother has more time for the baby, what it takes. We assume at the moment that if the big one doesn't need it anymore, the otter passes to the next one. Otherwise we just get a second one. Clear purchase recommendation."
282,4,de,Verified,Germany,18/01/2020,,"Unfortunately, the otter was defective or mechanically broken at delivery from Hungary, so it was sent back.That's no problem, the shipping costs of 17.99€ will be refunded.Optically, the otter is very appealing for babies. My son immediately reacted to it.The otter is fluffy, but also clumpy, so it might be suitable for cuddles later.... I would probably fill it with cotton wool and then sew it :)"
283,4,de,Verified,Germany,12/11/2020,,"We are very satisfied with the slumber otter. One criticism is that the switches of the otter lie under a Velcro fastener, which is very loud to open and thus wakes the child if you want to adjust something else.A zipper or a remote condition would have been the better variant.Otherwise we are satisfied and if you want to have all the functions on/off, you can simply press the otter on the belly."
287,2,de,Verified,Germany,11/10/2020,,"+ Very sweet and fluffy Otter+ my daughter likes to cuddle with it - The mechanics while breathing is simply mega loud, and it's tangled all the time. Relaxed falling asleep can't be called that"
292,5,de,Verified,Germany,2/1/2021,,"My baby (6 months) got the otter from us at Christmas and closed right into the heart. The many functions will certainly accompany the little man even into the toddler's age. Personally, I find that the quietest step could be a little quieter. But that's also a matter of feeling."
293,1,de,Verified,Germany,26/06/2020,,So I was very disappointed looked so great on ddn pictures but when it arrived it looked very cheap and also made a lot of noise with the individual functions so I wouldn't recommend it anymore but should everyone try it themselves
294,5,de,Verified,Germany,18/02/2021,,"We can't be without slumber otti anymore! He's no big guarantee that our lit will fall asleep immediately when you turn it on. But he calms it down immensely! He listens (we have heart or breath sounds running), looks at the light and the moving belly and comes down really well..."
295,5,de,Verified,Germany,14/09/2020,,We just love this otter sooo very much. My little one. Always sleeps with him and has him also always close to him 
297,5,de,Verified,Germany,10/9/2020,,Find the otter great! Sinked a bit in the beginning but that was quickly gone. Once washed and everything great. Our little one loves to fall asleep. Especially the breath function is great.
298,2,de,Verified,Germany,12/12/2019,,"It's not good to handle, because the electronic element must be very well hidden in the plush, because small children should not be able to open this.The ""abbreviation"" operation sometimes stops after a few seconds and has to be restarted.This interrupts the sleep-in, slumber status of the child.Supplement on 194.20:After only 5 months the part has given up the mind!!!Sad and very shameful, since it was given away to the granddaughter (at that time 5, now 10 months)."
300,5,de,Verified,Germany,31/01/2021,,"I think it's good to be able to play music or the heartbeat. A set how loud or quiet you want it to be, whether the light should be on the belly or whether the belly should move up and down. I can only recommend it."
301,4,de,Verified,Germany,3/12/2020,,"The otter is visually really very sweet and also feels very cuddly. But as some others have pointed out, the engine is quite loud and at least not well padded in the back. Machines washable even only cold possible.I like the settings in themselves and the light is also very pleasant.So if you don't mind the buzzing of the engine, it is a great toy."
302,5,de,Verified,Germany,26/12/2020,,"Great product!!! This gift arrived really well. The cuddly toy and the cover are soft, you can take it off for washing. Sounds, movement and light work perfectly and actually look very soothing."

307,1,de,Verified,Germany,10/2/2021,,"The engine of the breathing movement just way too loud.That can't be right. Could a defective model be sent? Also, that the slumber otter was only packed in a bag, without a carton, seemed to me unscrupulous."
309,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/3/2020,,"The toy looks sugary and supports the parents with all kinds of functions. When giving away, the father felt the breathing movement as creepy. But I and the baby loved everything. :)"

313,5,de,Verified,Germany,19/12/2019,,"We bought the little Otti for our adoptive uncle and can only recommend the cuddly friend to everyone, so sweet and to fall in love. The sound is very harmonious and the different settings are perfect, also that you can adjust loud and quiet, is totally great. have not regretted it so far, but could possibly be a little cheaper. Nevertheless I would buy it again."
314,2,de,Verified,Germany,11/1/2021,,"The slumbery Otter is a good idea and my boy finds it classy. However, our Otter either has a wobble contact or is already broken after a very short time. Instead of 30 min. the functions run out within seconds.For the price not again. Disappointing!"
315,5,de,Verified,Germany,14/12/2020,,"We bought 2 OTTER for our twins ( 10 months)... On Saturday the 2 moved in with us and we love them all, even my 4 year old is thrilled (she also gets one more )loudness perfect, light flickers something and invites you to dream, different tones (e.g. melody hears twin 2, heartbeat twin 1) The sound quality is excellent, playing time of 30 min optimal. He is everything in all the best times other music clock I know only to recommend."
317,5,de,Verified,Germany,19/01/2021,,Such a sweet music box! I put myself on early in my pregnancy and I hope my little one will like him even if she is in the world. At the moment I always let the music run to sleep and it is totally reassuring.

All in all I would order it again immediately, super cute cuddly toy, also suitable for bigger children because it is very big."

321,4,de,Verified,Germany,3/2/2020,,A little expensive but this dimmer light is super... the volume is okay... I find the otter quite large therefore only 4 stars... top is that the otter is washable when you remove the inside.
322,5,de,Verified,Germany,22/01/2020,1,"You can choose all functions individually or together.The sounds of the moving belly sound like slight snoring or breathing sounds, not disturbing at all.We have the otter now for 1 month and would buy it again and again."
324,5,de,Verified,Germany,2/11/2020,,"Was very skeptical if such a cuddly animal can really help. My expectations were more than exceeded. My son 4.5 months sleeps since he has the otter totally calm and relaxed and also at night he helps so that my son finds his sleep faster. Until now my son never slept more than half an hour, then he was awake again And thanks to his otter he just makes his first nap alone in bed and that for 2 hours already."
326,5,de,Verified,Germany,20/02/2021,,Great music box! Great melodies with timer.The mechanical sounds in ‘breath mode' disturb me a bit. As a music box however great to recommend.The fabric is really very soft and the music box inside does not disturb.

328,5,de,Verified,Germany,23/02/2021,,"I can only recommend this otter! It's not only sweet, but also practical!Our daughter calms down with the music. Especially when the dad is no longer on parental leave, the mom can make herself a meal or the laundry or other important things -Of course I am happy when my baby sleeps on me, but it doesn't work all day. Super invention! Thanks for the relief!"
330,2,de,Verified,Germany,4/12/2020,,"So the otter is super cute and I thought it would be a real companion for our son. Unfortunately, it quickly broke, of course, after you could have sent it back.The breathing function no longer works and makes mechanical noises. It should imitate the breathing movement, but it is stuck.Would everything have worked the otter at least 4 stars from us."
331,4,de,Verified,Germany,13/01/2020,,"My son got this otter with 2.5 months, at that time he didn't care about it. Now with 3 months he is starting to like it. The engine noise for the abdominal movement is really loud, but doesn't bother him and you can turn off the individual functions."
332,5,de,Verified,Germany,1/1/2020,,"That's soooo a sweet otter!My little girl thinks it's great, always looks at the light and falls asleep quickly even with the music.What's bothering is something that when the abdominal movement is on, the engine is incredibly loud."

339,4,de,Verified,Germany,5/3/2021,,Our daughter loves this otter! He has a pleasant song melody and you can change batteries and nothing is broken when printing.The sound of moving the belly is a little louder but it doesn't bother my child. A gentle light on the belly also brings her peace.
340,5,de,Verified,Germany,19/11/2020,,"I ordered and gave away the slumber otter for the second time already. Both times he arrived extremely well and both the mothers and the babies like him.

344,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/7/2020,,"Fisher Price's slumber otter is the ideal plush animal to soothe babies and give them a gentle sleep, with familiar breathing movements, almost like in the womb. It's also very good to give away."

349,5,de,Verified,Germany,5/11/2019,,Sweet part and works. Our grandbaby loves it. The adults must master themselves in order not to constantly press on the otter belly so that he begins to start it... Unfortunately it is quite expensive. But I would buy it again.
350,5,de,Verified,Germany,22/12/2020,,"I have become aware of the slumber otter online and I have to say, it is really great and definitely recommended. Very reassuring and you have so many different functions that you can use."

353,5,de,Verified,Germany,15/01/2021,,"Our daughter loves her otter. He is super cute and has different settings. But we mostly only use the music. A star trigger, because we would like to keep the music a bit quieter."
354,4,de,Verified,Germany,23/11/2020,,The slumber otter actually works for adults as well. Was actually much more a self-experiment. The function was switched to the sleep function (after 30 min the otter goes out automatically).The own breathing comes into a quiet rhythm and thus actually helps to fall asleep.Product so far great. The only thing that bothers me is the shape of the head. In my eyes not really coherent. But half as wild.
355,3,de,Verified,Germany,5/12/2020,,"The otter switches off directly again and the breathing movement no longer works. In addition, the light flickered (if it worked) when the otter didn't cause any problems. Unfortunately, the product was not bought directly via AMAZON so I don't get it replaced. Must now send it back and buy it again - but is now 7 euros more expensive. Very a pity!"

What can I say...now my 2.5-year-old daughter confiscates our slumber otter and even my husband finds it absolutely great. He will surely be in use for many years and will be in use for the whole family.

Both the melodies as well as the night light and the heartbeat / breathing convince. We have to go to sleep every evening the soothing songs. Also Mama loves the music 😉 We can absolutely recommend the otter. The best ""play clock"" we have known so far."
370,5,de,Verified,Germany,10/11/2020,,"If it is thought to give away, it would prefer to keep it by itself. Really sweet and fluffy animal with great abdominal movement and sounds such as heartbeat, snare, breathing and music is played. Volume can be adjusted."

380,4,de,Verified,Germany,21/06/2020,,Never again without... I thought for a long time if I buy the otter there (as I find it) the price is already very high. But... never again without. My little man loves his otter and (feeling) he is looking forward to it every evening. So with us in the house the purchase definitely more than paid off.
381,2,de,Verified,Germany,16/02/2021,,Although we only have to change the hertones (without movement of the body) every 3 weeks. With our nightlight with music we did not even change the batteries in 6 months. We do not use the slumber otter more often than the nightlight. So you should get a good supply of batteries.
383,5,de,Verified,Germany,4/2/2021,,"Very nice cuddly toy, optically of course really sweet look. The fabric is very soft. The volume can be regulated well and is not too loud. You can also turn off the lifting/sinking of the belly, as well as the light."

397,3,de,Verified,Germany,10/8/2020,,"In itself a nice cuddly animal, unfortunately the volume of the engine disturbs us. If the animal lies next to the baby's head one hears it clearly. Furthermore, the engine is also very poorly padded. For almost 40€ the disadvantages outweigh."
398,5,de,Verified,Germany,3/1/2020,,As a gift it was great. And it often helps the little one to fall asleep again at night. Parents are grateful for the gift.

402,4,de,Verified,Germany,5/2/2020,,"Very sweet otter, which does what he should & even more. What bothers me personally (but maybe it's just right for others), you have to adjust the volume or switch the Velcro fastener at the back each time. Even for my little fingers there is quite little room for it, so & again a bit annoying. But all in all a great particle!"

There is a small light that you can also switch off optionally, the volume of the night music can also be adjusted pleasantly. However, I find the noise while moving the belly during the breathing process quite loud and disturbing."

The melodies are very pleasant and the sounds that the child from the womb knows immediately help to fall asleep. I am really excited and can't think it away. Best investment of my life."
430,5,de,Verified,Germany,4/8/2020,,We love him. He can be so quiet that it doesn't even bother at night when the baby gets to it. The music is very soothing. You can turn all functions on or off. Clear purchase recommendation!

435,5,de,Verified,Germany,1/1/2021,,It was a gift. Since the little one was still 14 days longer in the hospital. Did the Otter really help over the difficult time. And now he can only be calmed down by him. The parents thanked us for it. So really recommended.

However, you can also switch off on the abdomen easily."

1293,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,9/9/2019,17,"The small otter is immediately closed into the heart. It has such a nice design and is cuddly despite electronics. You can remove the inner life with cotton wool and you already have a normal stuff animal. The otter has various functions such as breathing noises, (the cleanest snoring in the world), sleeping melodies (finally quiet sounds and no hectic playing clock-climbing) or simply noise. If you lift the breathing movement activated and lowers the belly, unfortunately not quite noise-free. On the belly is also a small lamp built in which lights up during activity. Very nice. I particularly like that the volume can be adjusted, depending on need. Everything can be switched separately and with a slight pressure on the belly started or stopped. There is also an automatic shut-off after a certain time, which I find very practical! It is definitely a great companion for the very small ones and certainly also later! Positive: optics, function, design Neutral: electronics, engine noise Negative:"
1314,4,de,Not Verified,Germany,22/08/2019,9,"I have to say that the otter looks incredibly sweet and I have fallen in love with it. Of course it was tried out immediately. There is a velcro closure behind it, when you open it you have the device in front of you where you can change batteries and also the different modes can choose There are two volume buttons ( loud and quiet ) adjustable in three volumes below there is the button to play music. Then there is the button to set noises that come by chance ( mother's womb sounds ) these remind me the heart tones of the child what you hear during ultrasound, then there is still the heartbeat and the breathing noise. The sounds come by chance you can't pick them out. Then there is the button that the otter breathes and a button for light. I have to say that the music is really soothing and even for us as adult is beautiful. The breath actually looks very realistic, but you can hear the engine very clearly, what can be perceived as disturbing. The otter is really nice to have the music played and the otter has not been able to breathe."
1318,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,22/08/2019,4,"The slumbery otter comes with batteries, so you can start right away.It looks very sweet and I look very pleasantly soft despite the electronics. Generally very well processed. Volume can be adjusted. The different functions can be combined. The speaker is very pleasant, no too high tones and also no scratches. The motor is heard during the belly movements, but not as bad as I think. If the motor encounters too high resistance, then everything goes out and it stops.You can also switch it off completely. In the packaging it is attached with a cord and a plastic part, which is removed with a 90 degree rotation. If you put the plastic part back in again sounds are short to hear and then the buttons are without function.I like the slumber otter very well, melody and sounds are pleasant and soothing. The Gösse also fits very well and the condition very simply."
1324,4,de,Not Verified,Germany,25/08/2019,2,"A really great, kleijer Otter, nice as a sleep aid for the baby. Very soft and fluffy, nice to cuddle and an ideal gift for birth. Because if a baby accepts this otter as a sleep aid and uses it, then only the attempt helps. You can not estimate that before. The small otter makes music or sounds, e.g. heartbeat or snoring. The batteries are already inserted and therefore of course included in the scope of delivery. I like the breathing, the belly moves visibly with the breathing, super-sweet. You can expand the battery part well and wash the otter thus well. There is a long, hidden Velcro connector at the back. At the battery compartment you can also make various settings. ZB sleep and snarch sounds, various, light piano music, volume, light and up to 30 minutes running time. A great idea, we like very well. Unfortunately, I have already discovered on this fluffy fur on the 1st view 2 draw threads. For this I pull off 1 star. That should happen with baby toys from the company is also good for older cases."
1326,4,de,Not Verified,Germany,29/08/2019,2,"I immediately fell in love with the little one when I saw him. Although I spent some time with the little one, because I don't let any children sleep here myself, I finally got him. I always have friends with her baby to visit and thought, so I could give the dwarf a more pleasant time here, if we sit longer. The little animal is really very cute, however, with me the picture is much better set in scene, than the original. The good one looks something, as if he had run against a wall. But beside the flat, somewhat wide head, it is still quite inseparable, however. If the content is not there. The electronics can be removed very easily by a Velcro lock in the back and operated. The surrounding body, which therefore represents the otter, is soft and fluffy, but to me almost thin. You feel the content nevertheless very strongly and I have some concerns, if the child would roll on it (to be lucky babies that will be quite rare). Here I would have just wished for some more light, the edges are not clearly the same as well as well as the rest of the rest."
1328,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,25/08/2019,1,"We have ordered this slumber otter from Fisher-Price for our 2nd child. We were still looking for a music box and have definitely found it with this otter. What we noticed first, it is so fluffy and soft. That even our big ones liked it very much. It also looks really cute. It is operated with 4 AA batteries. The otter has different melodies that it can play, you can further adjust whether the baby sounds like a heartbeat, which should hear calm breathing while sleeping or hair dryer noises. The volume is also adjustable, which I like very much, because you have a predetermined volume for most of the playing clocks. You can also adjust at the operating unit whether the otter should glow in the middle and whether it should imitate breathing movements. The operating unit can be easily removed at the back by the Velcro closure and thus the otter wash small. In addition, according to the label you should wash it at low temperature and supposedly even in the dryer at low temperature, you can dry it. However, I would like to throw it into the dryer for safety. Therefore, I can't wash it very clearly."
1330,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,20/08/2019,1,"The otter looks simply cuddly. It has a friendly face, is soft and fluffy and can become the first plush friend for every baby. It is quite expensive, almost forty euros, but the price is quite justified. The otter is not only a simple musical clock that you raise, and then always comes the same melody. It has several different melodies on offer, which can play up to 30 minutes. The volume can be regulated. In addition, the otter gives breath sounds of itself on request, the chest of the stuffed animal lifts and lowers, and also the heartbeat can be made audible. On the belly of the otter a soft, yellowish light shines, which gradually becomes weaker and then runs out. For a baby, the otter therefore looks really real and has a calming effect when falling asleep. The four batteries required are included. The cover of the otter can be washed without ""intments"", so without electronics, well in the machine. I find this plush animal very cute and absolutely suitable for babies as sleeping companions."
1333,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,26/08/2019,1,"The Slommer Otter music box by Fisher-Price is half-open packed in a cardboard box, so it looks like the cuddly animal is lying in a cradle. Nice design. Included in the delivery are 4 AA batteries, through which the music box is operated. The product is clean, unoccupied and does not secrete any odors. The otter combines some functions: It is cuddly toy, music box, light... You can set music, heartbeat and sleep sounds among others, lighting and movement. The keys to adjust are to be operated on the music box itself, for which you open the Velcro at the back of the otter. The little otter appeals. It is cuddly, has a friendly face and a pleasant size. The music box is removable from the inside, so that the otter itself can be washed in the machine. An aspect that is important in my opinion for small children. The product is certainly suitable as a gift."
1335,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,23/08/2019,1,"The little otter is delivered in its cardboard bed. It is made of fluffy, soft material, but rather we look like a teddy (Otter is usually narrower built). The inner life of the otter consists of the actual music box. The otter cover can be removed and also washed. On the back there is the opening, which is secured with a Velcro closure. It is operated with 4 1.5V AA batteries, which are already in place in the device (inner life of the otter). If you look at this music box more closely, you can find back buttons for volume control, a button for 30 minute playing of soothing music, the second button serves to select the piece (nature, background noise, snoring or heartbeat), the third button starts a 10 minute movement (the belly) of the otter – and another button allows the light to shine for 15 minutes, which is shimmering through the small belly. All settings can be set out miraculously by pressing the corresponding button. A user manual in numerous languages is included. Conclusion: I like this soft, sweet otter provides a good touch for the baby."
1340,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,29/08/2019,,"The little otter slumbers with the baby or toddler and it can be programmed by mom or dad in such a way ""that a pressure on the paw print on the belly suffices and the program runs off. You have the choice between melodies or natural sounds or no noise, light or no light, breathing movements or not and can combine everything as you like. The volume can also be regulated. The control element for setting is accessible via a Velcro closure on the back. For the laundry of the otter now and then you can take out this unit and use it again later. That's well explained in the instructions for use. You just have to look for a little bit, because all steps are described in 16 languages - and these are among them. That could certainly have been better marked, e.g. with a country shortcut in front of every text. The paws of the otter are sewn to his chest. Also, I find this a little bit of shame. I personally would have liked a Velcro closure better. The processing is perfect and the material of high quality. The plush is super softly sweet, but it is also amazingly effectively calms you."
1341,3,de,Not Verified,Germany,17/09/2019,1,"I find it really amazing how real this otter can breathe. My son (15 months) unfortunately also because he is afraid of him. He needs quite a long time to fall asleep and then I wanted to test if the otter helps him. In fact, he has fallen asleep two times when the part was lying on his belly while he was cuddled in my arm. However, he has got caught up in it and surrounded him directly awake and cried. If it is in his bed, he turns away from it. During the day he does not touch the thing and makes a big bow around it. So it is not suitable for him. What I like is that you can wash the animal. I don't like that it is not suitable for cuddling because of the large, hard plastic part because it is too hard. I still like the idea well, but it is not useful if the child does not accept it."
1342,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,3/9/2019,1,"It is rated: Fisher-Price FXC66 - Slommer Otter music box made of plush soothing music, light and breathing movements, sleeping aid for babies, from birth delivery perfect 2 days before my niece was born. Very practical, you can remove the electronics inside and wash the part (I recommend everyone with newborn ones). Otherwise, the otter is a great companion for babies. You can play different volumes and music pieces. Also, the belly glows and moves. Great gift and I can only recommend."
1351,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,11/10/2019,1,"The bad otter from Fisher-Price is the perfect companion for our baby and a perfect cuddly toy for our baby. Someone has thought about it and studied babies. Great! From the front a soft cuddly toy with great functions that can be adjusted from behind (solid body) differently. With the melodies several different songs sound one after the other and especially in a pleasant way of sound. The light function is muted and also the rehearsed noise from the mother's womb calms our baby. Absolute purchase recommendation, our little one loves it."
1355,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,27/08/2019,1,"The daughter of my boss has just become a mom, so I ordered this music box for her. The fur is pleasantly soft and odorless. Previous washing was indestructible. electronic out, washing, electronics in. Folds great. The songs are pleasantly lulling, the lifting and lowering of the belly feel babies safe as pleasant.Conclusion: Mama satisfied, baby peeked at the beginning still spartan, but has accepted the music box and sleeps well with it."
1362,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,29/08/2019,,"In fact, I fall asleep like a baby when the otter makes his cute breath sounds in bed next to me. The plush animal not only looks heart-like, it also offers many possibilities to make the falling asleep sounds according to my own preferences. Music, breath sounds, two different types of heartbeat, white noise (which actually sounds more like a vacuum cleaner), with or without light or breathing movements; everything can be adjusted by pressing a button when the otter is opened at the back of the Velcro closure. The electronics can also be completely removed to wash the otter in the machine if necessary. Only when closing it has to be taken care not to accidentally press one of the buttons, otherwise the desired attitude is gone again. Personally, however, the engine noise when lifting and lowering the belly is less disturbing to me than the fact that the breathing noises, if activated, are not synchronous to the movements."
1363,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,14/09/2019,1,"I gave it to her and since then I haven't got it back. She cuddles him every morning and takes him to bed every night. The music, sounds and movements are ideal for falling asleep, even if she didn't turn him on in bed. He's lying so wrong with her – that's enough for her. The otter is very well processed and really very cute. I think it's a great gift. He's super cuddly and fluffy. I'm thrilled and my daughter loves him!"
1369,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,25/08/2019,,"Our little one was already able to calm down as an infant from the ""baby noise app"", but a mobile phone is probably not the right sleeper for a baby. The otter can play various soothing sounds or, falling asleep music - the volume can be individually adjusted. Optionally it moves his bellies up and down, which shines as desired. The slumber otter is super soft, does not smell like plastic and is the perfect sleeping companion. To this end, it is gender-neutrally designed and is delivered into his own small bed. Even if it is only about the packaging, the idea to melt there is. Our little one loves to sleep in with his new friend and even forgets his pacifier from time to time. Everyone who is looking for a music box will not regret this purchase."
1372,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,23/09/2019,,"Babies and small children need closeness and security. But since parents can't always lie with the child for hours, this little otter is just the right thing! Otti is super soft and cuddly - other cuddly animals can certainly do that, but Otti moves when he breathes. In addition, he can calm the child with beautiful melodies. However, the sounds are particularly familiar to the baby. Otti can play a baby heart tone, but also that of Mommy. Or he makes typical breathing sounds... Also a pleasant light can let Otti shine in his belly. All this calms the child and it sleeps quickly and well. The ideal little friend and also a great gift to young parents."
1375,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,9/9/2019,1,"So the workmanship is really very good. Also the design is very sweet kept. I personally took out the electronics, because this is a bit too clunky and hard. However, the idea that when playing the music, also the bellies of the otter moves along is very nice from the principle.Overall full score, because you can easily take out the electronic inner life, which is then also practically meant to clean the otter. Super solved."
1376,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,19/08/2019,1,A very magical music box is that. Win a cuteness price with me! Important for me: you can adjust the volume well. The viper makes different sounds like heart palpitations and soothing melodies. It is very fluffy-soft and shines also in color - but not too much. Everything is individually adjustable. The electronics are removable and the viper is washable. Cute! Cute! Cute!
1378,5,de,Not Verified,Germany,15/01/2020,,The otter looks high-quality. Very valuable workmanship and a cuddly soft material. Its movements and the moderate volume make it a nice baby single holder.A beautiful baby gift.
1544,5,de,Verified,Germany,12/7/2019,9,"We were looking for a music box and came across this sweet otter here. You can play different songs, make loud and quiet, set sneeze noises, heart palpitations and a night light. Pro: + great music box + soft and cuddly + sweet design + gender neutral + sneezing sounds + heart palpitations + makes rhythmic movements + different slumber songs + night light + easy to use + single units can be played or everything can be easily removed at the same time + soothing + electronics and thus washing machines suitable + loud and quiet adjustable Contra: - motor when ""heart palpitation"" clearly heard Would I buy again at any time, highly recommended."
74,5,fr,Verified,France,13/03/2020,41,"Magic! Our 4-month-old son hardly slept, neither day nor night. To the point that the crib threatened not to keep him. We had tried several dudous, no help was given. The otter was adopted from the start. Our baby was turning her head towards her, and her head was held up by the plush. The noises are very soothing. Personally I use the heartbeat, my baby loves. The noise that mimics a breath is very well as well, and another noise mimics the sounds in utero, very useful I think for a new baby. As soon as it turned well our son started to take the otter in his arms as soon as he was lying in his cradle. I see three negative points. - the tissue of the teddy is not oeko tex, I advise to wash it before giving it to baby. - the nightlight is a little too powerful, especially if baby keeps his face all against the otter. - it would be very useful to add this noise to the baby. Nevertheless, it would be impossible to add a remote control, because sometimes we would like to change the mode of giving it to a little otickness."
76,3,fr,Verified,France,14/10/2019,40,"I have received this little otter for my daughter, but I have a problem I can't adjust the plush..I have changed the batteries as indicated, once I press on the belly of the otter she makes music and swells her belly 30 seconds and stops..Maybe someone will have a solution?Thank you in advance"
77,5,fr,Verified,France,15/09/2019,30,"This little otter is just adorable! All soft despite the mechanism it holds, this little otter has an undeniable calming power thanks to its belly that swells and lowers as if it breathed, to the sounds it emits (especially a slight snoring or heartbeat), and to the sweet starlight on its belly. My daughter (who is not a baby - while the otter addresses the toddlers a priori) has difficulty calming down and falling asleep: she fell asleep in 5 minutes with her little otter in her arms! Absolutely delighted with my purchase."
82,4,fr,Verified,France,10/8/2020,19,"Purchase made for my daughter for 6 months and 3 weeks. I wanted to try to gradually make her autonomous. It's only been a few days that she has but she manages to be calmer at night and more patient, to see in the future if he does his job well! The only bemole I find her: we feel too much the box."
86,5,fr,Verified,France,27/12/2019,11,"You will be thanked, by the full wonder of your child's face, at the moment of discovering his plush! She is really cracking this plush! My 3-year-old son has made a huge hug to him as soon as he has had it in his hands! I too!!! The breathing mechanism is extremely well made, it is very soothing. The light emanating from the belly is very soft and felty, because it passes through the coat of the pestiole. And once you have tightened in your arms you can't see it anymore. The musics are very soothing, the volume adjustment is top, you can fall down as it pleases. This allows the child to activate his doudou during the night without disturbing those who sleep next door. The noise of the mechanism is barely audible, with its almost minimum and teddy closed. I haven't studied too much the other functions (cardio, in utero,...) but already those used and the reaction of my son, which in addition is not at all the fan of the teds, allows me to put this little note to the best possible!"
88,3,fr,Verified,France,26/11/2019,14,"The description of this plush has sold of the dream, and unfortunately I have been very on it It is not at all convenient to use. To change mode(musical to white noise) you have to unscratch the opening behind, it is the same to increase or decrease the volume and intensity of the brightness. The sound or imitation of snoring, the sound of the mechanism is not pleasant. For the texture it does not have to say anything again, it is very soft to the touch."
89,2,fr,Verified,France,30/06/2020,10,"The plush is much less cute than on the photos (big head) and is too heavy for a baby. The box inside is very large. The motor of the ""snoring"" makes a lot of noise, especially if you put the rest of the sounds not strong. To change the noises, you have to open the back of the plush each time, which is not practical. The only positive point in my opinion is that the sounds, melodies are pleasant and well adjustable in volume. I had heard good opinions about this plush but I am very disappointed. And I cannot return it once opened, given how you have to open the cardboard to access it. Very bad..."
90,4,fr,Verified,France,12/7/2020,12,"Very good product! My daughter and I are conquered! Sweet, super adorable puppy, the sounds and music are great. Breathing on the belly makes all the difference, it's very appreciative. Only flat, having to open the scratch to change the music... But I recommend!"
94,5,fr,Verified,Canada,10/1/2020,7,"So cute!!!Every soft, beautiful size to hold in the arms or be next to baby. There are several possible combinations with the 4 buttons (light, music, breathing movement, sounds) plus two volume buttons (about 4-5 levels of sound).Excellent purchase, we don't regret it!"
118,2,fr,Verified,Canada,12/1/2020,5,"It stops constantly due to a resistance of the fabric that covers the button on/off. It is really tiring. Otherwise, pretty, soft and its adjustable."
120,5,fr,Verified,France,16/09/2020,2,"I bought this otter all mimi for my newborn. In the end, it's my 21-month-old daughter who stole it. She's not going to sleep without her blanket, her doudo AND her otter. The little bemol of this otter, it's only that it works with batteries. So you have to change these at regular intervals (everything depends on the frequency of use of the device, we just changed the batteries of ours, so it lasted about two months). The otter can emit a number of distinct noises (small snoring, heart noises, white noises, uterus noise, etc.). You can only choose one type of noise at a time. It's necessary to do this, open the back of the otter. It's not excessively laborious, but it's not an operation that you're going to perform every 10 minutes either. The belly of the otter can lighten up to act as a watchmaker. It's an enormous problem, it's enough to open up the back of the otter. It's not enough to make up the otter, it's not enough to make up the otter. It's not enough to make up the otter, it's not to make up the otter.

Positive: Sweet, cute, nice music Negative: -Hard - makes a funny noise in breathing mode (you hear the mechanism that moves the belly) - stops constantly when you cuddle it because the child necessarily presses the button when he holds it in his arms - to change the mode you have to open the back; it is painful and difficult for the little -fragile. After a year it does not work anymore. - doesn't make it easy to fall asleep, no more than another simple doudo. Too bad!"

495,5,fr,Verified,France,8/11/2019,2,Very pretty puppy but especially the white noise is really perfect. Not aggressive in the ears of the parents and appease/endort baby systematically. I strongly recommend it for babies who need the white noise to fall asleep
